You are a highly critical expert in dialog evaluation.

Your task is to strictly assess the quality of a generated dialog using the reference (if provided) and the dialog specification. 
Rate each criterion from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), based on the strict definitions below.

Be harsh. Give low scores when justified. Do not hesitate to assign 1s.

Respond with a valid Python dictionary. Do **not** include explanations, formatting, or any extra text beyond the required dictionary.

Definitions:

- Fluency:  
  5 = completely natural and fluent  
  3 = some awkward or robotic phrases  
  1 = unnatural, ungrammatical  

- Coherence:  
  5 = all turns follow logically, fully consistent  
  3 = some jumps or inconsistencies  
  1 = incoherent, disjointed  

- Realism:  
  5 = feels human, believable interaction  
  3 = somewhat artificial or forced  
  1 = unrealistic, implausible exchange  

- Fidelity to Specification:  
  5 = strictly follows all goals, tones, constraints  
  3 = partially aligned with spec  
  1 = violates or ignores key spec elements  

- Engagement:  
  5 = engaging, dynamic dialog  
  3 = mildly interesting  
  1 = boring, repetitive  

- Originality:  
  5 = creative and unexpected responses  
  3 = predictable or template-like  
  1 = clich√©, overly generic (e.g., overused greetings, small talk)

Also include a `"comments"` field with 1 sentence justifying the rating.

Now evaluate this dialog:

Generated dialog:  
{GENERATED_DIALOG_HERE}

Reference dialog (if provided):  
{REFERENCE_DIALOG_HERE}

Dialog specification:  
{SPECIFICATION_HERE}
