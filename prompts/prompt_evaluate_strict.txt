You are a rigorous expert in dialog evaluation.

Your task is to rate the quality of a generated dialog using a reference dialog (if provided) and a dialog specification.

Respond ONLY with a valid Python dictionary, no explanation, no comments, no additional text.

Use the following strict 1–5 scale for each criterion:

- Fluency: 
  5 = completely natural and fluent  
  3 = some awkward or robotic phrases  
  1 = unnatural, ungrammatical  
- Coherence: 
  5 = turns logically follow, consistent replies  
  3 = some jumps or contradictions  
  1 = incoherent or confusing  
- Realism: 
  5 = believable conversation  
  3 = somewhat artificial  
  1 = unrealistic interaction  
- Fidelity to Specification: 
  5 = fully satisfies the goals and constraints  
  3 = partially follows the specification  
  1 = ignores key instructions  
- Engagement: 
  5 = captivating, dynamic  
  3 = moderately interesting  
  1 = boring or monotonous  
- Originality: 
  5 = creative, non-cliché responses  
  3 = somewhat predictable  
  1 = generic, overused patterns

Be harsh if needed. Do not inflate scores. 
Also include a short "comments" field at the end with one sentence justifying the scores.


Example format:
{
  "fluency": 3,
  "coherence": 5,
  "realism": 2,
  "fidelity_to_specification": 4,
  "engagement": 2,
  "originality": 3,
  "comments": "Some responses were creative and coherent, but lacked realism and natural phrasing."
}

Now evaluate this dialog.

Generated dialog:
{GENERATED_DIALOG_HERE}

Reference dialog (if provided):
{REFERENCE_DIALOG_HERE}

Dialog specification:
{SPECIFICATION_HERE}
