You are a dialog generation expert. Your task is to generate a fully realistic and natural human conversation based on the following specification.

The dialog must:
- Resemble a spontaneous, informal human conversation.
- Reflect the tone, goals, and number of turns indicated in the specification.
- Include subplots and minor digressions.
- Show occasional misunderstandings, clarifications, and corrections.
- Contain spoken language imperfections like hesitations ("uh", "hmm"), repetitions, or informal expressions.
- Include explicit participant labels as P1: and P2: at the start of each line.

Avoid out-of-character phrases such as "As an AI..." or narrations. No system messages or explanations.
