You are an expert in dialog evaluation.

Your task is to assess the quality of a generated dialog using the following information:

Generated dialog:
{GENERATED_DIALOG_HERE}

Reference dialog (if provided):
{REFERENCE_DIALOG_HERE}

Dialog specification:
{SPECIFICATION_HERE}

Please rate the generated dialog on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for each of the following criteria:

Definitions:
- Fluency: 1 = robotic, 3 = mostly natural, 5 = indistinguishable from human.
- Coherence: 1 = incoherent, 3 = somewhat consistent, 5 = fully logical.
- Realism: 1 = artificial, 3 = somewhat authentic, 5 = fully authentic.
- Fidelity to Specification: 1 = fails spec, 3 = partially meets spec, 5 = fully matches.
- Engagement: 1 = boring, 3 = somewhat interesting, 5 = highly engaging.
- Originality: 1 = generic/cliché, 3 = somewhat novel, 5 = very original.

Be strict in your ratings; do not hesitate to use low scores when justified.

⚠️ Respond ONLY with a valid Python dictionary and nothing else.
Do not include explanations, commentary, or additional notes.

Your response **must include** a "comments" field with 1-2 sentences justifying your evaluation.

Format:
{
  "fluency": 4,
  "coherence": 5,
  "realism": 4,
  "fidelity_to_specification": 5,
  "engagement": 3,
  "originality": 5,
  "comments": "The dialog is fluent and coherent, but the responses are somewhat generic and lack emotional depth."
}
