P1: How's life been treating you? It feels like we last caught up ages ago.
P2: Yeah, I know, it's crazy how time flies! I've been keeping busy with work and trying to travel more.
P1: That sounds amazing! I'm a bit jealous, to be honest. What's been your favorite trip so far?
P2: Oh, definitely Japan. The food, the culture... everything was so fascinating. You should totally go!
P1: Yeah, I've always wanted to... I'll have to start saving up, haha.
