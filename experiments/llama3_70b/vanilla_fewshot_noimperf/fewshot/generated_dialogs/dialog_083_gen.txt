P1: I just finished reading "The Quantum Prophecy" and it's absolutely mind-blowing. Have you heard about it?
P2: No, what's it about? Is it a new release?
P1: Yeah, it's relatively new. It's a sci-fi thriller that explores the consequences of time travel.
P2: That sounds fascinating. So, what did you think of the plot twists?
P1: Well, I thought they were really well-executed. I mean, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time... the whole time... I'm getting repetitive, aren't I?
P2: No, it's okay! I'm just really interested. Did you find the scientific explanations believable?
