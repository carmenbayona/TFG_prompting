P1: Hi, I'm Karen, I just moved into the house next door. I wanted to introduce myself and welcome you to the neighborhood.
P2: Oh, nice to meet you, Karen! I'm Mike. How do you like the area so far?
P1: It's great, very quiet and the people seem really friendly. I've been trying to get to know everyone on the street.
P2: Yeah, we're a close-knit community. So, what brought you to our neck of the woods? You know, I've been meaning to ask... did you buy the house or are you renting?
P1: We bought it, yeah. We just got married and were looking for a place to start our life together. We love the area, it's perfect for us.
P2: Aw, congratulations! I didn't know that. Let me ask you again, are you guys going to, you know, have kids soon?
