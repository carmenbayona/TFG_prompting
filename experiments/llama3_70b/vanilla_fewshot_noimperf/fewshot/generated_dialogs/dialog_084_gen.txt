P1: The new sci-fi movie just got amazing reviews. It's about a group of astronauts who get stranded on a distant planet.
P1: I heard the special effects are mind-blowing. The director really pushed the boundaries of CGI technology.
P2: Wow, I've been meaning to see it. Is it more action-oriented or do they focus on the characters' personal struggles?
P1: It's a good mix of both. The action scenes are intense, but the characters' relationships and conflicts are what drive the story forward. I think you'll really enjoy it.
P2: That sounds great. I'll definitely check it out. What was the name of it again?
