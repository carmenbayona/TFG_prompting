P1: Oh my gosh, I have the best birthday surprise for Sarah!
P1: She's going to be so shocked! We're taking her to that new trampoline park she's been wanting to go to...
P2: That sounds like a blast! What made you think of it?
P1: Yeah, I know, right? I was talking to her sister, and she told me it's her favorite place... 
P2: That's so sweet of you! Does Sarah have any idea what's going on?
