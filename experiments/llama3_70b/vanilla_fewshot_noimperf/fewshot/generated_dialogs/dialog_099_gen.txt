P1: I'm telling you, this new smartphone is a total disaster. The battery life is atrocious.
P2: Really? I was thinking of getting one. What's the issue exactly?
P1: Well, like I said, the battery life. I can barely get through a day without needing to recharge.
P2: Hmm, that's weird. Have you tried, uh, turning off location services or something?
P1: Yeah, I've tried that. And I've even turned down the brightness. But honestly, I've done that with my old phone too, and it still lasted way longer. This one's just...it's just bad.
