P1: So, for our group project, we need to create a marketing campaign for a new product launch.
P2: That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me more about the product?
P1: Right, so it's a smart home device that tracks your energy usage and helps you reduce waste. We need to target environmentally conscious consumers.
P2: Okay, got it. And what's the timeline for the campaign? Do we have any specific deadlines?
P1: Yeah, we need to launch in six weeks, so we should start brainstorming ideas and assigning tasks by the end of this week.
P2: That's a pretty tight schedule. So, you said we need to target environmentally conscious consumers... can you repeat that?
