P1: So, I've been coming to this restaurant for years, and I've got to recommend the specials board.
P2: Oh, really? What's usually on it?
P1: Well, they change it seasonally, but if you're a fan of seafood, you'll love the grilled salmon with a citrus sauce.
P2: Mmm, that sounds amazing. Is it a lot?
P1: Actually, the portions are really generous, so you won't leave hungry. Plus, it's a great value for the price.
P2: Alright, I'm sold! I'll try the salmon.
