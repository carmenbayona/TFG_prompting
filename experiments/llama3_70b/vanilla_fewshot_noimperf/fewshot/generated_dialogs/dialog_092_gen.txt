P1: I was thinking of taking a day off next Wednesday. Would that be okay?
P2: Yeah, that should be fine. What's the occasion?
P1: Oh, just need to take care of some personal stuff. You know how it is.
P1: So, do I just need to put in a formal request or...?
P2: Yeah, just put in the request and I'll take care of it.
