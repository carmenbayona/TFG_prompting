P1: Oh man, it's been ages! How've you been? You look great, by the way.

P2: Thanks, you too! I've been good, just keeping busy with work and stuff. You know how it is. So, what's new with you? 

P1: Yeah, I do. So, I actually just got back from this amazing trip to Italy. It was incredible! I mean, have you ever been? 

P2: No, I haven't, but I've always wanted to. What was your favorite part? Did you try any good food? You know I love Italian food...

P2: Oh, and by the way, speaking of food, do you remember that time we tried that new pizza place downtown?
