P1: Hey, have you had a chance to think about the group project we need to start working on?

P2: Yeah, I was just going over the assignment actually. It sounds like a really cool project. What are your thoughts on it?

P1: Well, I was thinking we could start by brainstorming some ideas... um... what was I going to say? Oh, so we could get a sense of what everyone's interested in.

P2: That's a great idea! I was thinking we could also make a list of the tasks that need to be done. You know, like a to-do list" sort of thing. Do you think that would be helpful?

P1: Absolutely! A to-do list would be really helpful. And maybe we could also... oh, wait, what's the deadline for this project again?

P2: Let me check... *rummages through notes* Yeah, it's due in three weeks. So we should definitely make a plan and stick to it if we want to get everything done.
