P1: Hey, so I was thinking we could head out to the lake house this weekend. The weather's supposed to be really nice.

P2: Oh, that sounds amazing! I've been dying to get out of the city for a bit. What's the plan, exactly?

P1: Well, I was thinking we could, uh, we could... I don't know, go for a hike or something. There are some really beautiful trails nearby. And then maybe we could, you know, have a picnic lunch.

P2: That sounds perfect. I've never been to that lake house, what's it like? Is it, like, super secluded or what?

P1: Yeah, it's pretty secluded, but in a good way. You know, it's just far enough out of town that you feel like you're getting away from everything, but still close enough that you're not, you know, totally roughing it or anything.
