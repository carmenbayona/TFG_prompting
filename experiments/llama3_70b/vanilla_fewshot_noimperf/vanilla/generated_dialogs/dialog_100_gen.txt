P1: You know, I was checking the weather forecast this morning, and it looks like we're in for a pretty wild ride.

P2: Oh, yeah? What's going on? Is it going to be, like, super hot or what?

P1: Well, actually, there's a front coming in tonight, and it's supposed to bring some pretty intense thunderstorms. They're even talking about a chance of hail.

P2: Hail? Whoa, that's crazy! I've never seen hail before. Is it, like, pretty accurate, this forecast?

P2: Yeah, they're saying it's, like, 90% sure or something. So, yeah, it's gonna happen. And, you know, it's supposed to clear up by tomorrow morning, so at least it's not going to ruin the whole weekend.
