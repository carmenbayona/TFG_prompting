P1: Hey, I just met our new neighbors yesterday. I was out in the backyard when they were moving in.

P2: Oh, really? What are they like? Did you talk to them at all?

P1: Yeah, we chatted for a bit. They seem really nice. You know, I was telling them about the neighborhood, and... and the park nearby, how great it is for kids. 

P2: That's awesome! Did they have kids? And what did they say about the park?
