P1: I just finished reading this amazing new book, "The Lost City". It's an absolute page-turner.

P2: Oh, I've been hearing so much about it! What's it about? Is it a thriller or an adventure story?

P2: (laughs) Yeah, I do. So, you're saying it's like, a historical fiction kind of thing? Did you find the characters relatable?
