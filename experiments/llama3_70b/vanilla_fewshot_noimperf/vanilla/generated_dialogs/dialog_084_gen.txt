P1: Oh man, have you seen that new sci-fi movie that just came out? I just got back from the theater and I'm still reeling from the special effects! What did you think of it?

P2: Actually, I'm not entirely sure which movie you're talking about... could you remind me of the title or the plot?

P1: Ah, sorry! I guess I assumed everyone was talking about it. It's called "Galactic Rift" and it's about... (pauses) wait, no, that's not it. It's about this group of scientists who discover a portal to another dimension... or is it the other way around?

P2: (laughs) Okay, slow down! I think I'm getting the gist of it. So, what made it so mind-blowing?

P1: Right! So, the visual effects were insane! The way they depicted the alternate dimension was just... whoa. And the plot twist at the end? I did not see that coming at all! (repeats excitedly) I mean, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!

P2: (intrigued) That sounds amazing. I'll have to check it out. But just to clarify, you said it's a sci-fi movie, right? Not fantasy or something else?
