P1: Hey, did you catch the game last night? The Yankees really pulled off an upset win!

P2: Wait, what? I thought they were down by three runs in the eighth inning. How did they manage to come back?

P1: Yeah, it was crazy! They scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth, and... and... oh, you know, that new pitcher they just signed? He really made the difference.

P2: Which one? The guy from the Cubs? I thought he was still injured.

P1: No, no, it was the other guy... uh... what's his name... Ah, Johnson! Yeah, Johnson kid. He was amazing.
