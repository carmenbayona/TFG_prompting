P1: So, I was thinking about making a doctor's appointment, and I realized it's been a while since my last checkup.

P2: Oh, yeah! I've been meaning to do that too! How do you usually go about making an appointment?

P1: Um, let me think for a sec... Okay, so usually I just call them up and ask for the next available slot. Unless it's an emergency, of course.

P2: That makes sense. Do they, like, remind you when the appointment is coming up or something?

P1: Yeah, they usually call or email you a reminder. And sometimes they even send you a text, just to make sure you don't forget.
