P1: So, when you order at this place, you gotta know what you want beforehand. They don't really have a lot of time to explain the menu to you.

P2: Yeah, that makes sense. I've heard the lines can get pretty long. But what's the deal with the specials board? Is that stuff really special or is it just, like, leftovers?

P1: Ha! No, no, it's not leftovers, I promise. The specials are actually some of the most popular dishes, but they're only available for a limited time. They like to rotate them out every few weeks or so... or so. (laughs)

P2: Okay, cool. So, if I want to try something new, I should go for the special then? And what's the deal with the "market price" thing on the menu? Is that, like, a warning" or something?
