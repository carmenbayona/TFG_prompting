P1: So, have you been following the recent developments in the trade policy? I think it's really interesting, and I'd love to share some insights I've gathered.

P2: Uh, yeah... I mean, I've been trying to stay up to date, but to be honest, it all seems so... complicated. Can you, like, break it down for me?

P1: Absolutely! So, basically, the new tariffs are supposed to boost our domestic production, but I think it's going to end up hurting our relationships with other countries. I mean, we've already seen China retaliating, and it's going to be a matter of time before others follow suit. If I can just... (pauses to collect thoughts) ...if I can just find that article I read last week, it had some great points on this...

P2: That sounds really interesting. I had no idea it was that complex. Can you tell me more about these retaliations? Like, what exactly are they doing?
