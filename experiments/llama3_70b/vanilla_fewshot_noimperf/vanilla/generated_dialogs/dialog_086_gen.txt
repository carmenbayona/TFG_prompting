P1: Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the city center from here?

P2: Absolutely! You're not far at all. If you head down this street for about three blocks, you'll hit a big intersection with a fountain in the middle.

P1: Okay, got it. Three blocks, fountain... So, when I get to the fountain, which way do I go? Left, right, or straight?

P2: Right, yeah... So, when you get to the fountain, you'll want to take a right. And then just keep going straight for about... um... five minutes, maybe? You can't miss it. You'll see a big sign that says "City Center".
