P1: So, tell me, what makes you think you're a good fit for this role?

P2: Honestly... I've been to a few interviews recently, and I just... I don't know, it feels like I'm just going through the motions, you know? But this company, it's different. I've heard great things about the work environment...

P1: That's terrific to hear! We do prioritize our employees' satisfaction. Now, let's talk about your qualifications. Can you walk me through your relevant experience?

P2: So... I've been working on... uh, similar projects in my previous role... I think. (laughs nervously) Sorry, I'm just really interested in this position, and I don't want to mess it up. But to answer your question, I have about three years of experience in the field...

P1: Excellent! Three years is definitely sufficient. I'm curious, what do you hope to achieve in this role, specifically? Is there something that drew you to this position?

P2: Exactly! That's what I was trying to say earlier... (smiling) I want to contribute to the company's mission and learn from the team. And, if I'm being completely honest, I've heard the company does a great job of promoting from within, and that really excites me...
