P1: I'm telling you, the new smartwatch from Xtech is a total lemon. I mean, I was so excited to get it, but the battery life is terrible. It lasts only a day and a half, max.

P2: That's weird. I've been thinking of getting one. What's the display like? Is it as bright as they claimed?

P2: Oh, the display is fine, it's... it's fine. But the battery life, I'm telling you, it's a deal-breaker. I've tried everything - turning off notifications, reducing the screen brightness... nothing makes a difference. It's so frustrating.

P2: Hmm, have you tried resetting it or updating the software? Sometimes that can make a big difference. And what's the exact model you have? Is it the X5 or the X7?

P1: Yeah, I've tried all that. I've even contacted their customer support, and they just keep telling me to reset it. It's like they're not listening. And I have the X7. It's supposed to be their flagship model, but honestly, it feels like a cheap knockoff. I mean, I've had better experiences with my old fossil watch.

P1: I'm just so disappointed, you know? I thought they were a reputable brand. I guess I'll just have to start looking for a new watch. Ugh, it's such a hassle.
