P1: I just watched this amazing film called "The Prestige" and I still can't get over the twists and turns.

P2: Oh, I've heard of it! Isn't that the one with the rival magicians? I've been meaning to check it out.

P1: Exactly! It's about these two magicians, Angier and Borden, who engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic consequences. The way the story unfolds is just masterful.

P2: That sounds so intriguing! I love a good mystery. Did you figure out the secrets before they were revealed, or were you completely surprised?

P1: Ah, I'd say I was partially surprised. I mean, I suspected some of the plot twists, but the final reveal just blew my mind. The way Christopher Nolan uses misdirection is incredible.

P2: Wow, I need to watch it now! Do you think it's one of those films where you need to watch it multiple times to catch all the clues?
