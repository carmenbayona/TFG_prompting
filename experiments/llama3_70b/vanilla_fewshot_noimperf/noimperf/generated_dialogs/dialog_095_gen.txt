P1: Hey, I've been planning a surprise birthday party for our friend Emma, and I think I've got everything covered.

P2: That new restaurant she's been wanting to try? Is that where you're having it?

P1: Actually, no. I was thinking of having it at her favorite park. The weather's been great lately, and it'll be more casual and intimate. Plus, I've already booked a live band that plays her favorite type of music.

P2: That sounds amazing! What's the theme of the party? Is it a big milestone birthday or something?
