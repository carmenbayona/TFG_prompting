P1: I think it's essential to understand the recent tax reform and its impact on the middle class. Did you know that the reform has increased the standard deduction, but also eliminated some crucial tax credits?

P2: That's really interesting. I hadn't realized that. But can you explain why the government thought it was necessary to eliminate the tax credits?

P1: Well, the government claimed it was to simplify the tax code and reduce tax evasion. However, many experts argue that it's a move to benefit large corporations and the wealthy, rather than the middle class.

P2: I see. So, it's kind of a trade-off between simplicity and fairness. I'm not sure I agree with the government's priorities, though. Do you think there's a way to achieve both simplicity and fairness in the tax system?
