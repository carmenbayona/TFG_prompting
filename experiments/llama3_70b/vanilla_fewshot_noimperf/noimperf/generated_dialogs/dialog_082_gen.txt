P1: Hi there! I'm so excited to help you navigate our menu today. We have a lot of great options, but I want to make sure you know about our specials.

P2: Oh, specials? That sounds intriguing. What kind of specials do you have? Are they seasonal or just things you're trying to get rid of?

P1: Ha! No, nothing we're trying to get rid of, I promise. Our chef actually created a new dish just for this week, and it's been getting rave reviews. It's a Korean-inspired BBQ beef taco.

P2: Mmm, that does sound really good. But I'm also in the mood for something a little lighter. Do you have any salads that are particularly popular?

P1: Absolutely! Our summer harvest salad is a favorite. It's got fresh corn, avocado, and a citrus vinaigrette that's just perfect for this time of year.

P2: That sounds amazing. I think I'll go with the salad, but can I ask, what's the most popular item on your menu? Just in case I want to come back and try something else.
