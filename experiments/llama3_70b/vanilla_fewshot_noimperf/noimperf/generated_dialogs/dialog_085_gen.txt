P1: Hey, it's so great to finally catch up with you! I've been thinking about you a lot lately, especially since I got back from my trip to Japan.

P2: Oh, wow! Japan? That sounds amazing! What made you decide to go there, and what was your favorite part of the trip?

P1: Well, I've always been fascinated by their culture, and I got an amazing deal on flights, so I just decided to go for it. And, oh, there were so many amazing experiences, but if I had to pick one, it would be visiting the Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto. Have you ever seen pictures of those thousands of vermilion torii gates? It's truly breathtaking.

P2: That does sound incredible! I've seen pictures, but I can only imagine how stunning it must be in person. Did you get a chance to try any of the local food, like ramen or okonomiyaki?
