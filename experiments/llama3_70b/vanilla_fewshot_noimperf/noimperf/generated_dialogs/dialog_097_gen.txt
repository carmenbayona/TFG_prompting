P1: Hey, have you had a chance to review the project brief? I went through it last night and I have a good sense of what's expected from us.

P2: Yeah, I skimmed through it, but I'm still a bit unclear on the timeline. Can you walk me through the key milestones and deadlines?

P1: Absolutely. So, we have a kick-off meeting scheduled for next Wednesday, and from there, we have four weeks to complete the project. We'll need to submit a mid-term report after two weeks, and then the final report is due at the end of the fourth week.

P2: That sounds pretty tight. Have you thought about how we're going to divvy up the workload among the team members? We don't want anyone to fall behind.
