P1: Hey, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?

P2: Actually, I was thinking of trying out that new hiking trail that just opened up. Have you heard about it?

P1: Yeah, I've been meaning to check it out! How did you hear about it? Was it through a friend or online?

P2: Yeah, my coworker was just raving about it yesterday. She said the views are amazing. But I'm not sure if I should bring my dog or not. Do you think it's dog-friendly?
