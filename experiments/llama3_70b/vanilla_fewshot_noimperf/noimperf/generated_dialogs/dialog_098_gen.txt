P1: Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the marketing position at your company. I'd be happy to walk you through my qualifications and experience.

P2: Absolutely, I'm excited to learn more. Can you start by telling me a little bit about your background in marketing? What specific areas have you focused on in the past?

P1: Sure thing. So, I have about 5 years of experience, mostly in digital marketing. I've worked with a few different agencies, where I focused on social media strategy and content creation. Most recently, I was responsible for leading a campaign that resulted in a 25% increase in followers.

P2: Wow, that's impressive. How did you measure the success of that campaign, and what do you think contributed to its effectiveness?
