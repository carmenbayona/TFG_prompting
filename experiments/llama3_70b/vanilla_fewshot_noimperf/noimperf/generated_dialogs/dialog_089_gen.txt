P1: Hi, I'm having some issues with my laptop's battery. It's draining way too fast, even when I'm not using any resource-intensive apps. Do you think it's a software issue or something more hardware-related?

P2: That's really interesting. I've heard some people having similar issues, but I've never really looked into it myself. Can you tell me more about your usage patterns? Like, do you keep it plugged in most of the time or do you use it on the go?

P1: Yeah, I'm a freelancer, so I'm always on the go. I'd say I use it around 70% of the time on battery power. And I've tried calibrating the battery, but that hasn't made a difference. Do you think it could be a problem with the battery itself, like it's just worn out or something?

P3: That's a good point about the calibration. I've heard some people saying that can make a big difference. But worn out batteries are definitely a possibility. I've heard some people saying that lithium-ion batteries have a certain number of charge cycles they can handle before they start losing capacity. Do you know how old your laptop is?
