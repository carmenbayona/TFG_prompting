P1: Hey, did you catch the game last night? The Bulls are on a roll, winning their fifth straight!

P2: No way, I was stuck at a work event! What was the final score? And did Zach LaVine have a good game?

P1: Yeah, LaVine was on fire! He scored 32 points, and the Bulls won 118-102. And get this - they're now just two games behind the Bucks for the top spot in the East.

P2: That's amazing! I've been saying all season that they have the potential to go deep in the playoffs. Did you see the highlight reel of that crazy dunk by Wendell Carter Jr.?
