P1: Hey, have you met the new neighbors who just moved in last week? I was wondering if you've had a chance to introduce yourself.

P2: No, I haven't had the time yet. What are they like? Are they friendly?

P1: Oh, they're super nice! I went over to welcome them with a batch of fresh-baked cookies, and we chatted for a bit. They're a young couple, both working from home, so I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of them.

P2: That sounds wonderful! I'll have to take some fresh fruit over soon. Did you get a sense of what they do, exactly? Are they freelancers or remote employees?
