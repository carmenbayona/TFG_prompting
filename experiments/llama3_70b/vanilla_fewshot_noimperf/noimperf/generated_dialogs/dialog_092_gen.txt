P1: Hey, I was thinking of taking a day off next Thursday. Would that be okay with you? I've got a personal thing I need to take care of.

P2: Hmm, let me check the schedule real quick. (pause) Yeah, it looks like we're not too slammed that day, so it shouldn't be a problem. What's the personal thing, if you don't mind me asking?

P1: Oh, no, it's just a doctor's appointment I've been putting it off for a while, and I finally got a slot that day. Nothing too exciting. But thanks for asking!

P2: No worries, happy to help! You know, I've been meaning to ask you, how do you like your doctor? I've been looking for a new one, and I trust your judgment.

P1: Ah, my doctor is great! Super friendly and thorough. I've been going to her for years. I can give you her name if you're interested.
