P1: Hey, can I talk to you for a minute about the meeting this morning?
P2: Yeah, sure... what's up?
P1: You seemed really distracted, like, you weren't even paying attention to the discussion on the Johnson account.
P2: Hmm, I'm sorry about that... I was just, uh, going over some deadlines in my head.
P1: Deadlines? What's going on? You're not usually like that in meetings.
P2: We've got a lot on our plate right now, and I'm feeling the pressure... I don't know, I just zoned out for a bit, I guess.
P1: Okay, but is everything okay? You're not overwhelmed or anything?
P2: No, no, I'm fine... just trying to prioritize, you know? We've got so many projects due soon, and I don't want to drop the ball on any of them.
P1: Yeah, I get it... but maybe we can, like, delegate some tasks or something? I don't want you burning out on me.
P2: Yeah, that's not a bad idea... thanks for understanding, man. I appreciate it.
