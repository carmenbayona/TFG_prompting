P1: Oh, I've been hearing so much about your dog training skills, I'm really impressed! You must be doing something right.
P2: Ah, thanks! Yeah, it's just a lot of patience and consistency, you know? My dog, Max, he's a smart boy, but he can be stubborn sometimes.
P1: I can imagine! I've always wanted a dog, but I don't know if I'd be good at training one. You make it sound so easy, though.
P2: It's not easy, trust me! (laughs) But, you know, it's all about setting boundaries and rewarding good behavior. I've been working with Max on agility training lately...
