P1: So, have you been following the recent developments in the tax reform debate?
P2: Hmm, not really, I mean, I've seen some headlines, but I haven't had a chance to dive in deep. What's the latest?
P1: Well, basically, the Republicans are trying to push through this huge overhaul, but the Democrats are fighting it, saying it's gonna benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
P2: Yeah, I figured as much. But, uh, what's the deal with the whole "trickle-down" theory? I never really understood how that's supposed to work.
P1: Right, so the idea is that if you give tax breaks to corporations and the rich, they'll invest that money and create jobs, which will then benefit everyone else. But, in reality, studies have shown that most of that money just gets pocketed or used for stock buybacks.
