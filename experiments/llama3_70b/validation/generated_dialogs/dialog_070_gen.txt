P1: Hey, I'm having some trouble with the printer. It's just not printing anything.

P2: Okay, what's the error message say?

P1: Uh, there isn't one. It just says "printing" but nothing comes out.

P2: Hmm, that's weird. Have you tried turning it off and on again?

P1: Yeah, I've tried that a few times. It doesn't seem to be making a difference.

P2: Okay, let me think for a sec. Did you recently change the ink or anything?

P1: No, I don't think so. I mean, I don't usually mess with that stuff.

P2: Alright, well, we can try checking the ink levels real quick. Can you get on the computer and check the printer settings?

P1: Yeah, sure thing. (pause) Okay, it says the ink levels are fine.

P2: Okay, that helps to rule that out. Let me think... Is the paper jammed or anything?

P1: No, I've checked that too. I'm starting to get really frustrated with this thing.

P2: I know, I know. It's super annoying. But we'll figure it out. (pause) Okay, so what were you trying to print when it stopped working?

P1: Just a document for work. Nothing too important, but I need to get it done today.

P2: Alright, let me take a look. Can you bring the printer over here and we'll take a closer look?

P1: Yeah, sure thing. Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.

P2: No problem, happy to help. We'll get this figured out.
