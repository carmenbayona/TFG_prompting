P1: Oh my god, I have the best idea for your birthday surprise!
P2: What is it? You're being super secretive.
P1: Okay, so I was thinking... hmm, how do I explain this... we could rent a boat and take it out on the lake!
P2: A boat? That sounds cool, but what's the surprise part?
P1: Right, so the surprise is... uh, we'll have all your friends hiding on the boat, and then we'll yell "Surprise!" when we get to the middle of the lake!
P2: That's actually really clever. How did you come up with that?
P1: I don't know, I just started thinking about what would be fun, and... and... I don't know, it just came to me!
