P1: Hey, have you seen my phone charger? I could've sworn I left it right here on the counter.

P2: Hmm, no, I haven't seen it. When was the last time you used it?

P1: Uh, I think it was yesterday morning. I'm pretty sure I plugged it in before I left for work.

P2: Okay, let me think... I didn't see it when I was cleaning up last night, but I might've moved it by accident. Did you check your bag or your desk at work?

P1: Yeah, I already checked my bag and my desk. I even asked my coworkers if they'd seen it. Nobody's seen it.

P2: That's weird. Okay, so it's not in the living room or the kitchen... have you checked your room?
