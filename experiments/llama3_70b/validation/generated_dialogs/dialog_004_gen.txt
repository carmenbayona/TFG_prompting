P1: Hey, thanks for agreeing to take a look at my thesis draft. I really appreciate it.

P2: No problem, happy to help. I've had a chance to read through it, and overall, it's looking good.

P1: Yeah? I'm still pretty unsure about the whole thing. I feel like I'm just throwing a bunch of ideas together.

P2: Well, let me tell you, it's definitely not that bad. You've got some great points in there. But, uh, there are a few areas where you could, you know, flesh things out a bit more.

P1: Okay, like what? I'm all ears.
