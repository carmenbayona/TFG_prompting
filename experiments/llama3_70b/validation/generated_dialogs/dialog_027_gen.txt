P1: So, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What's going on? You're being super mysterious.
P1: Hmm, okay, so... our CEO, he, uh, he accidentally set the coffee machine on fire.
P2: What?! How does someone even do that?!
P1: I know, right? Apparently, he was trying to, uh, "improve" the coffee-making process or something.
P2: Improve it? By setting it on fire?!
