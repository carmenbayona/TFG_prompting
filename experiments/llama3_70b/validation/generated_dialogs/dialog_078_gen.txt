P1: Hey, I was thinking we should try out that new caf√© that just opened up downtown. You know, the one with the cute outdoor seating area?
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been meaning to check it out. How's the coffee supposed to be?
P1: Hmm, I've heard good things. My friend Emma went last weekend and said it's really strong. You know how she's a coffee snob, so...
P2: Yeah, Emma's always on top of the latest coffee trends! Okay, yeah, that sounds great. When were you thinking of going?
