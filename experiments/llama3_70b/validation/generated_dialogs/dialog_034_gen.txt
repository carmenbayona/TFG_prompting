P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: Try me! What's going on?
P1: So, uh, I was at my desk, and I heard this huge crash from the conference room.
P2: Hmm, did someone break something?
P1: Yeah, it was crazy. I went in, and the whole table was flipped over, and there were papers everywhere!
P2: Oh wow, what was going on in there? Was it a meeting or something?
P1: No, no, it was just Sarah trying to... hmm, how do I explain this... 
P2: (laughs) Take a guess!
P1: (laughs) Okay, so she was trying to get this huge box of files off the top shelf, and she lost her balance... 
P2: (laughs) And it all came crashing down!
P1: (laughs) Exactly! And the best part is, she was so embarrassed, she just stood there, frozen, with papers stuck to her shoes.
