P1: Hey, have you tried that new coffee shop downtown?
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been meaning to check it out. What's it like?
P1: Uh, it's really good, actually. I went there yesterday with Sarah.
P2: No way, I was gonna ask her to grab coffee with me this week! How is it? Is it better than The Daily Grind?
P1: Hmm, yeah, I think so. The atmosphere is way cozier, and their lattes are amazing.
P2: That sounds perfect. You wanna grab coffee there with me this Friday?
P1: Yeah, sure! I'd love to. But, you know, it's kinda small, so we might have to grab a table quick.
P2: Awesome, I'll meet you there at 2 pm? And, hey, can I invite Sarah too?
