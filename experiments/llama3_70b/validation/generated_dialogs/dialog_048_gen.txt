P1: Oh man, I'm so down for a weekend getaway! We haven't taken a break in ages.
P2: Totally! I've been feeling like we need to get out of the city for a bit. Where were you thinking of going?
P1: Hmm, well... I was thinking maybe the beach? I've been hearing great things about this new resort that just opened up.
P2: That sounds amazing! But isn't it, like, super expensive?
