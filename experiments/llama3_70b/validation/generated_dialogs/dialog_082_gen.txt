P1: So, have you been to this restaurant before?
P2: No, I haven't. I've been meaning to try it out, though. What's good here?
P1: Oh, their pasta dishes are amazing. I had the spaghetti Bolognese last time and it was really flavorful.
P2: Hmm, that does sound good. But I'm in the mood for something a little lighter. Do they have any good salads or sandwiches?
P1: Yeah, their grilled chicken sandwich is popular. And they have a few salads, like a house salad and a Caesar. Uh, let me think... P2: (interrupting) Oh, do they have a veggie burger? P1: Yeah, they do! It's actually really good. My friend had it last time and she loved it. P2: Okay, cool. I might get that then. What's the service like here?
