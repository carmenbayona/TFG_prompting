P1: Hey, do you wanna help me bake some cookies today? I've got all the ingredients ready.
P2: Oh, yeah! I love baking cookies! What kind are we making?
P1: Uh, I was thinking of doing chocolate chip. You know, classic.
P2: Mmm, my favorite! Can I help with the measuring? I'm really good at that part.
P1: Hmm, sure thing! Let me just get the recipe out real quick. *rummages through drawer*
P2: Oh, can I ask, are we doing the big soft ones or the crispy ones?
P1: Oh, good question! I was thinking of doing the soft ones. You know, the chewy kind?
P2: Yeah! Those are the best! I love when they're still a little warm from the oven.
