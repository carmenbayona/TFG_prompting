P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office today.
P2: What's up? You look like you're enjoying some inside joke.
P1: So, I was at the coffee machine, and I saw Karen from HR spill coffee all over the conference room carpet.
P2: Oh no, that's awful! Was it a big mess?
P1: Huge! I mean, it was like a coffee lake. And the best part is, she tried to clean it up with a stapler.
