P1: Oh man, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday!
P2: What's going on? You look like you're about to burst out laughing.
P1: Hmm, well... so, Karen from HR spilled coffee all over the conference room table...
P2: (laughs) That's not funny, that's just a mess! Was it a big meeting or something?
P1: (laughs) Yeah, it was, like, the quarterly review or whatever. And the worst part is... (pauses) she tried to clean it up with her scarf!
P2: (surprised) Wait, what?! Why would she do that?!
