P1: Oh my god, it's been ages! How have you been?
P2: I've been good, good. Just busy with work and stuff. You know how it is. How about you? What's new with you?
P1: Hmm, well, I just got back from this amazing trip to Japan. I was there for two weeks and it was incredible! The food, the culture, the scenery... everything was just so amazing.
P2: Wow, that sounds amazing! I've always wanted to go to Japan. What was your favorite part of the trip?
P1: Uh, that's a tough one. I think it was the food, definitely. I mean, I've had sushi before, but it's a whole different level when you're actually in Japan. And we also went to this tiny little ramen shop in Tokyo that was just... wow.
