P1: So, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: Try me! What's going on?
P1: Okay, so I was at my desk, just typing away, and suddenly...
P2: (laughs) suddenly what?
P1: ...and suddenly, our CEO walks in and starts doing a little dance on top of the conference table.
P2: (laughs) What? That's insane! Why was he doing that?
P1: Apparently, he just found out we landed that big client we've been chasing for months.
P2: Ah, nice! Congrats to you guys! So, was everyone... uh, enjoying the dance?
P1: (laughs) Yeah, it was pretty funny, but also super awkward. I mean, he's like, 60 years old...
P2: (laughs) That's amazing. Did anyone take a video or something?
P1: Yeah, our intern was quick enough to grab a clip. I'll have to send it to you later.
P2: (laughs) Please do! I need to see this.
