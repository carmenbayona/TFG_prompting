P1: Hey, I need to talk to you about something work-related.
P2: What's up? Everything okay?
P1: Yeah, everything's fine. I just need to request a day off next Thursday.
P2: Oh, okay. What's going on?
P1: I've got a family thing I need to take care of. My sister's birthday, actually.
P2: Ah, happy birthday to her! How old is she going to be?
P1: Uh, 25, I think. Yeah, 25.
P2: Wow, that's a big one! You guys doing anything special?
P1: Yeah, we're having a little party at my place. Just a small get-together.
P2: That sounds like fun. So, you'll be out the whole day, then?
P1: Yeah, probably. I'll make sure to get all my work done before I leave, though.
P2: Okay, cool. I'll make a note of it. Anything else I need to know?
