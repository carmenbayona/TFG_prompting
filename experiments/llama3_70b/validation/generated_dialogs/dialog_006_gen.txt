P1: Hi, Doctor. I'm really worried about these headaches I've been getting lately. They're just so frequent and intense.

P2: I understand. Can you tell me more about them? How often are you getting them, and how long do they last?

P1: Uh, I'd say... three, four times a week? And they can last anywhere from a few hours to, like, a whole day. And it's not just the headache itself, it's... it's the fatigue, the sensitivity to light... it's just really affecting my daily life.

P2: I see. And have you noticed any triggers that might be causing these headaches? Do you get them more often during stressful periods or...?

P1: Yeah, I guess so. I've been going through a really tough time at work lately. And, to be honest, I've been really anxious about it. I mean, I'm worried I might lose my job. Do you think that could be contributing to it?

P2: Hmm, definitely possible. Anxiety can definitely exacerbate headaches. But we should also rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be causing it. Can you tell me more about your anxiety? How have you been coping with it?
