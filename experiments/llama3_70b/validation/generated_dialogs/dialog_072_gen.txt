P1: Hey, how was your weekend? Do anything fun?
P2: Oh, it was good, yeah. Uh, I went hiking on Saturday with some friends.
P1: No way! Where did you go? I've been meaning to get out and do some hiking myself.
P2: We went to Red Rock. You know, just outside the city? It was really beautiful, though.
