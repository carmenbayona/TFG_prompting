P1: Oh my god, guess what?!
P2: What's up? You look like you're about to burst!
P1: I got the internship! I'm going to be working at Google this summer!
P2: Ah-mazing! Congratulations! That's incredible news!
P1: Thanks, I'm still on cloud nine! I was so nervous about the interview, but I guess it paid off.
P2: You must've killed it! We should celebrate, like, tonight! What do you say?
P1: Hmm, I don't know... I was thinking maybe just a quiet dinner with my family...
P2: No way, no way! You need to mark this occasion! How about we grab some drinks and catch up with the gang at that new bar downtown?
P1: That sounds awesome, but... uh... I don't know if I'm ready for a big party just yet...
P2: Okay, okay, we can keep it low-key then! Just a few close friends, and we'll make it a celebratory dinner instead?
