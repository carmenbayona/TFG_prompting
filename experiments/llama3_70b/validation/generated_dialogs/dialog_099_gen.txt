P1: I'm so fed up with this new smartphone I got, it's been a nightmare.
P2: What's wrong with it? You just got it, didn't you?
P1: Yeah, I did. But the battery life is atrocious. I mean, I'm lucky if I get five hours out of it.
P2: Hmm, that does sound bad. Are you using a lot of apps or...?
P1: No, no, it's not that. I mean, I'm not even using it that much, you know? Just the basics, really. And it's still dying on me.
P2: That's weird. Did you try, uh, resetting it or something?
