P1: Hey, have you heard about what happened in the office yesterday?

P2: No, what happened? You look like you're about to burst laughing.

P1: (laughs) Okay, so apparently, John from accounting spilled coffee all over the conference room table during a meeting.

P2: (gasps) Oh no, that's awful! Was it a big meeting?

P1: Yeah, like, the whole marketing team was there. And get this - he tried to play it cool and just kept talking like nothing happened.

P2: (laughs) That's so John. Was everyone really upset?

P1: Uh, surprisingly, no. I mean, people were a bit annoyed, but mostly everyone was just laughing and trying to help clean up the mess.

P2: Hmm, that's weird. Did he, like, apologize or anything?

P1: Oh, yeah! He sent out this super formal email afterwards, saying how "deeply regretful" he was... it was so over-the-top.

P2: (laughs) That sounds like John, all right. I'm surprised he didn't offer to buy everyone coffee to make up for it.

P1: (laughs) Actually, he did! That's the best part. I mean, I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna take him up on that offer, but...
