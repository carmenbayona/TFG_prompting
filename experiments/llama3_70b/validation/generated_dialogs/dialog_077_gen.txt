P1: Hey, I'm really stressing out about this assignment, do you know when it's due?
P2: Ah, yeah! Let me check... *pauses* Okay, it says here it's due next Wednesday.
P1: Next Wednesday? Are you sure? I thought it was this Friday...
P2: Hmm, no, I'm pretty sure it's Wednesday. But I can double-check with the prof if you want.
P1: Yeah, that would be great, thanks. I don't wanna be stuck doing it last minute... *sighs*
P2: Yeah, no problem. So, how's it going so far? Do you need any help or anything?
