P1: Oh man, did you catch the game last night?
P2: Which game? I was out with some friends, what happened?
P1: The basketball game! Our team won, can you believe it? They were down by 10 with only 5 minutes left!
P2: Whoa, that's crazy! I had no idea. So, what was the final score?
P1: Uh, let me think... hmm... it was 102-98, I think. Yeah, 102-98!
