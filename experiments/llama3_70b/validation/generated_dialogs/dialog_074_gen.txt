P1: Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, how's your dog doing? I saw him the other day, and he looked so cute!
P2: Oh, thank you! Yeah, he's doing great. He's been getting a lot of exercise lately.
P1: That's awesome! I've been thinking about getting a dog myself. What's his name again?
P2: His name is Max. He's a golden retriever.
P1: Ah, nice! Golden retrievers are such great companions. How old is Max?
P2: He's about two years old now. We got him when he was a puppy.
P1: Aw, that's so sweet. I'm sure it's a lot of work, but it's worth it, right?
P2: Absolutely! He's such a sweet boy. Uh, speaking of which, I've been trying to train him to stop barking at the mailman.
P1: (laughs) Yeah, that can be tough. My friend had a dog that used to do that too. Did you try, like, desensitizing him or something?
P2: Hmm, no, not exactly. I've just been trying toReward him when he doesn't bark. But it's not working that well.
P1: Yeah, that can be tricky. Maybe we can look up some tips online together sometime?
P2: That would be great, thanks! I'd really appreciate that.
