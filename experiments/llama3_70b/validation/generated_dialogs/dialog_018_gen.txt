P1: Hey, I was just checking the attendance list and I noticed you weren't in class yesterday.
P2: Oh, yeah... I had a dentist appointment. I had to get a filling.
P1: Ah, okay. So, are you planning on coming to class today?
P2: Uh, I think so... I mean, if I don't have any, you know, after-effects from the anesthesia.
