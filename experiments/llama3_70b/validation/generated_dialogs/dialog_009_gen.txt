P1: Oh, I thought we were leaving for Paris on the 15th?
P2: (sigh) No, we're leaving on the 12th, I told you that last week.
P1: Hmm, I could've sworn... uh, what's the hotel situation looking like?
P2: (frustrated) That's what I'm trying to figure out. I booked the room, but I think I messed up the dates.
P2: I'm trying to get it corrected, but their customer service is a nightmare.
P1: Wait, what do you mean you messed up the dates? Did you book it for the wrong days?
P2: (sigh) Yeah, I think so... I'm trying to get them to switch it to the 12th to the 19th, but they're giving me a hard time.
P1: Okay, well, can you just cancel it and book a new one? That might be easier.
P2: I wish it were that simple... they're saying there's a penalty for cancelling this late.
