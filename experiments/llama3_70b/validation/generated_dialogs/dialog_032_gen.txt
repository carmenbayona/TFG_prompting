P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office today.
P2: What's going on? You look like you're about to burst out laughing.
P1: I am, actually. So, I was at my desk, and I saw Karen from HR walking by with this... this... thing on her head.
P2: What thing? What are you talking about?
P1: Hmm, it was like a... a cat ear headband. Yeah, that's what it was. It was bright pink and had little bells on it.
P2: Wait, what? Why was she wearing that?
P1: That's the best part. Apparently, it's "Wellness Wednesday" or something, and she thought it would be a great idea to promote stress relief through... through... cat cosplay.
