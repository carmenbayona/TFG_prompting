P1: Hey, have you seen the sink in the kitchen? It's leaking all over the place.
P2: Ah, yeah, I noticed it this morning. Didn't think much of it, just figured it was a loose faucet or something.
P1: A loose faucet? That's not just a little leak, it's like a steady stream! We need to get it fixed ASAP.
P2: Okay, okay, I get it. I'll take a look at it later today. Can't promise anything, but I'll try to tighten it up or whatever.
P1: Later today? Can't you do it now? I don't want water all over the countertops and floor.
