P1: Hey, just wanted to remind you about our meeting with the client tomorrow at 2 pm.
P2: Tomorrow? Uh, I thought it was today...
P1: No, no, it's tomorrow. I sent you the calendar invite last week.
P2: Hmm, must've missed it. What's the meeting about again?
P1: We're going to discuss the marketing strategy for their new product launch.
P2: Right, right. I remember now. Thanks for reminding me!
