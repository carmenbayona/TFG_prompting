P1: Hey, what's up for this weekend? Got any plans?
P2: Oh, man! I was thinking we could go hiking! The weather's supposed to be amazing.
P1: Hiking, huh? I don't know, I'm not really feeling that adventurous. What's the trail like?
P2: It's not too bad, I promise! We can take the easy route. And we can make a day out of it, pack a picnic... it'll be super fun, I swear!
