P1: Hey, I'm really not doing great today. I don't know, just feeling really overwhelmed and anxious.

P2: Aw, sorry to hear that. What's going on? You can talk to me.

P1: Hmm, it's just... work has been stressing me out, and I had a fight with my sister last night. And I don't know, it just feels like everything is piling up.

P2: Yeah, that sounds tough. You know, sometimes when it feels like everything is going wrong, it can be really hard to... uh, to see a way out of it.
