P1: So, I was thinking we should make a doctor's appointment for you, you've been putting it off for a while.
P2: Yeah, I know, I know, I've just been really busy lately. What made you think of it now?
P1: Well, I was talking to my sister the other day and she was saying how she's been going to the doctor regularly and uh, it got me thinking that maybe we should do the same.
P2: That's a good idea, I guess. Do you know of a good doctor around here?
P2: Wait, what kind of doctor were you thinking of?
