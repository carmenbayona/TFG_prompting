P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What? Did someone finally get fired?
P1: Uh, no... actually, it was kinda the opposite. So, Karen from HR walked in on the CEO playing ping-pong in the conference room.
P2: What? That's insane! Was he, like, having some kind of stress relief session or something?
P1: Hmm, no... I think he just really likes ping-pong. I mean, he was going all out, sweating and grunting... it was pretty funny, actually.
P2: (laughs) Oh my god, that's amazing! Did anyone else see this?
P1: Yeah, like, half the office was gathered around, watching. I think some people were even taking bets on who would win â€“ the CEO or the intern he was playing against.
P2: (surprised) No way! Did the intern win?
P1: (laughs) Yeah, yeah... he crushed him! I think the CEO was pretty disappointed, but he took it like a champ. He even offered to play a rematch next week.
P2: (still in shock) I... I don't even know what to say. How did Karen react to all this?
P1: Oh, she just rolled her eyes and muttered something about "unprofessional behavior"... but I think she was secretly amused too.
P2: (laughs) I can imagine. So, did this whole thing affect the rest of the workday?
P1: Actually, it kinda lifted everyone's mood. We all needed a break from staring at our screens anyway.
