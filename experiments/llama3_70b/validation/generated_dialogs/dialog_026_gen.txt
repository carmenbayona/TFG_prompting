P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: Try me, what's going on?
P1: So, I was at the water cooler, and I saw Karen from HR... uh... tripping on her own feet.
P2: Oh no, is she okay?
P1: Yeah, she's fine, but it was just so... (laughs) You had to be there, I guess.
P2: (laughs) I can imagine. That can be pretty embarrassing. Was anyone else around?
P1: Yeah, like, the whole office was staring. I felt so bad for her, but at the same time... (chuckles) it was just really funny.
P2: Hmm, I can see why you'd find it funny. Did she, like, spill anything on herself or was it just a trip?
P1: No, no, just a trip. But the best part is, John from accounting was trying to help her up... and he tripped too! (laughs)
P2: (laughs) No way! That's amazing. I'm surprised nobody got hurt.
