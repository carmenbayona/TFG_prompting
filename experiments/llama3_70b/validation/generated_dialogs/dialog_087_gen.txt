P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked for the weekend! I've got plans to go hiking on Saturday.
P2: Hmm, that sounds awesome! Where are you planning to go?
P1: Uh, I was thinking of heading to Red Rock Canyon. I've been wanting to check it out for ages.
P2: Never been there, but I've heard great things. Are you going with a group or solo?
P1: Yeah, a bunch of friends are coming. We're gonna make a whole day of it. You should come!
