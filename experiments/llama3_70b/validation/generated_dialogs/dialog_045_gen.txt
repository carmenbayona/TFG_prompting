P1: So, we need to figure out what to get mom for her birthday, right?
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been thinking about that all week! She's going to love whatever we get her, I just know it!
P1: Okay, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I was thinking maybe we could get her that new kitchen appliance she's been wanting.
P2: Hmm, which one? The stand mixer? I don't know, I feel like she already has one of those... or does she?
P1: Uh, no, I think it's the immersion blender. She mentioned it last time we had dinner over there.
P2: Ooh, yeah! That's perfect! She loves cooking, and it would be so convenient for her!
