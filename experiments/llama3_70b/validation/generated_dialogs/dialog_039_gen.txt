P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What's that? You know I love a good story.
P1: So, I was at my desk, just doing my thing, when suddenly...
P2: (laughs) suddenly what? You're killing me!
P1: (laughs) Okay, okay. So, the fire alarm goes off, right?
P2: Whoa, that's crazy! What happened?
P1: Uh, apparently someone left a sandwich in the break room microwave for, like, an hour.
P2: (laughs) No way! That's so stupid. Did everyone evacuate?
P1: Yeah, we all had to go outside. It was pretty chaotic, actually.
P2: Hmm, I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. We do have some microwave abusers around here.
P1: (laughs) Yeah, I know, right? Anyway, the best part is...
P2: (excitedly) what? Tell me!
P1: One of the interns thought it was a real fire and started yelling "The building is on fire!"
P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's amazing! I wish I was there to see it.
