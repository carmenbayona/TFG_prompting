P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office today.
P2: What's going on? You look like you're about to burst.
P1: Okay, so I was at the coffee machine, and Karen from HR spilled coffee all over the conference room table.
P2: That's not that unusual, right? I mean, she's a little clumsy.
P1: Yeah, but here's the kicker - she was trying to impress the new CEO, and she ended up setting the tablecloth on fire! 
P2: Wait, what? How did she...? Did anyone get hurt?
