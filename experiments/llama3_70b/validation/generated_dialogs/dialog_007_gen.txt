P1: Hey, how's the workout routine going? You've been slacking off lately, huh?
P2: Yeah, I don't know, man... I just can't seem to get back into it. I feel so out of shape.
P1: Ah, don't be too hard on yourself. You're just having a little setback. We can get you back on track, no problem. What's been holding you back, though?
P2: Hmm, I think it's just... I don't know, I feel like I'm not making progress fast enough, you know? Like, I'll go to the gym for a week, and then I'll just stop.
P1: Okay, well, let's break it down then. What's your goal, exactly? Are you trying to lose weight, or build muscle, or...?
P2: Uh, I guess just to feel healthier, you know? And have more energy throughout the day. But it's like... every time I start, I'll get all motivated, and then I'll just fall off the wagon again. It's so frustrating.
