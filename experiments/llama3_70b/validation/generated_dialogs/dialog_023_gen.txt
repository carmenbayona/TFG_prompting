P1: Oh man, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: Try me, what's up?
P1: So, I was in a meeting with John and Sarah, and... (pauses for comedic effect) ...the fire alarm went off.
P2: No way! What was going on?
P1: I know, right? Apparently, someone burned their lunch in the microwave.
P2: (laughs) That's amazing. Was it Sarah's infamous fish soup?
P1: (laughs) Uh, no, I think it was... hmm... actually, I'm not sure. But we all had to evacuate the building.
P2: That must've been chaos. Were people freaking out?
P1: Oh, yeah. John was getting all worked up, like, "This is a disaster!" (mimics John's voice) But I was just standing there, laughing, 'cause it was just so ridiculous.
P2: (laughs) That's so you. Did they figure out who did it?
P1: Nope, it's still a mystery. But I heard the microwave is now off-limits to everyone. (chuckles)
