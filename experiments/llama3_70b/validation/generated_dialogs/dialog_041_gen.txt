P1: Oh my god, I'm so excited to tell you about this new yoga class I've been going to!
P2: What's so great about it? I've been thinking about trying out yoga, but I don't know...
P1: You have to try it! It's literally changed my life. The instructor, Rachel, is amazing. She's got this really calming energy...
P2: That sounds really nice. Is it, like, super intense or more beginner-friendly?
