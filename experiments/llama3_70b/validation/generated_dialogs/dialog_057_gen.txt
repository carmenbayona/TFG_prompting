P1: Hey, have you guys ever thought about taking a pottery class?
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been wanting to do that for ages! I've heard it's super relaxing.
P1: Totally! I just got back from one yesterday, and it was so much fun. We made these adorable little mugs.
P2: No way! That sounds amazing. Did you, uh, have any experience with pottery before?
P1: Nope, not at all. It was my first time, and the teacher was really great, so it didn't matter.
P2: That's awesome! I've always been fascinated by ceramics. Do you think I could, like, join you guys next time?
P1: Yeah, definitely! We're actually having another class next week. You should totally come!
P2: Yeah! I'll try to make it. What's the, hmm, what's the schedule like? Is it every week?
P1: No, it's every other week. We're gonna be doing, uh, vases next time, I think.
P2: Vases sound cool! I'll have to, you know, clear my schedule. Thanks for inviting me!
