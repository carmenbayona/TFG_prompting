P1: Hey, have you tried that new sushi place that just opened up downtown?
P2: Oh, yeah! I went there last weekend and it was amazing!
P1: Really? What was it like? Was it, uh, traditional style or more modern?
P2: Hmm, I'd say it's a mix. They have some classic rolls, but they also have some really unique ones, like this one with, uh, fried capers on top.
P1: Fried capers, that sounds interesting. Was it good?
P2: Yeah, it was so good! And the fish was really fresh, you could tell.
P1: That's great to hear. How's the pricing? Is it, like, super expensive?
P2: No, no, it's pretty reasonable. I mean, not cheap, but you get what you pay for, you know?
P1: Yeah, definitely. And the atmosphere, is it, like, a casual spot or more fancy?
P2: It's really nice, actually. They have this big window seat area, and it's just really... zen, you know?
