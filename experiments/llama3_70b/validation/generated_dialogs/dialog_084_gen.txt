P1: So I finally watched that new sci-fi movie everyone's been talking about.
P2: Oh, yeah? Which one's that? I've been meaning to check it out.
P1: Uh, it's called "Galactic Odyssey". It's about this group of astronauts who travel to a distant planet...
P2: Hmm, sounds interesting. Is it a sequel or something?
P1: No, no, it's a standalone film. Anyway, the special effects are just amazing. The visuals are so realistic.
P2: That's cool. I love sci-fi movies with good special effects. Did you like the storyline, though? Was it believable?
