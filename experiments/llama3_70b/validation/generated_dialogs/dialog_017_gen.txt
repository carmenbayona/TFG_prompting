P1: Oh my god, guess what?! I just got the internship in Berlin! I'm beyond thrilled!

P2: Ah, congratulations! That's amazing news! How did the interview go? You must have nailed it!

P1: Yeah, I'm still on cloud nine... Uh, the interview was really good, I think. I mean, it was Skype, so it was a bit weird, but...

P2: Yeah, Skype can be tough. But you must have done great if you got it! What made you want to apply for this internship in the first place?

P1: Hmm, I don't know... I just love Berlin, you know? The vibe, the culture... And the company is really cool, they do some amazing projects...

P2: That sounds awesome! So, what kind of projects will you be working on? Are you allowed to talk about it?
