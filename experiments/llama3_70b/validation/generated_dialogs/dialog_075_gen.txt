P1: Hey, I saw your post on the school forum about being interested in coding? 
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been wanting to learn more about it, but I don't know if I'm good enough. 
P1: Good enough? There's no such thing! We're all learning, and our club is a great place to start. We meet every Thursday after school. 
P2: Hmm, I'd love to, but what kind of projects do you guys work on? Is it, like, super advanced stuff?
