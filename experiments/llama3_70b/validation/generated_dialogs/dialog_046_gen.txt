P1: Hey, wanna go hiking this weekend? I was thinking of checking out that new trail that just opened up.
P2: Oh, yeah! I've been dying to get out on the trails again! What's the trail like? Is it tough?
P1: Uh, from what I've read, it's supposed to be moderate. I mean, there are some inclines, but it's not, like, super intense or anything.
P2: Hmm, sounds perfect! What time were you thinking of heading out? I gotta make sure I've got my gear ready.
