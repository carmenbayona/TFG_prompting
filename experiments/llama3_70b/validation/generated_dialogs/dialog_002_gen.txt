P1: So, did you book the flights like we discussed?
P2: Uh, I thought you were gonna take care of that?
P1: What? No, we agreed that you would book them. Don't you remember?
P2: Hmm, I could've sworn... I apologize, I must've gotten it mixed up.
P1: Okay, well, can you do it now? We need to confirm the travel arrangements ASAP.
P2: Yeah, of course. I'll do it right away. Sorry again for the mistake.
