P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What's going on? You look like you're about to burst.
P1: Okay, so I was at the coffee machine, and I saw Karen from HR... hmm, how can I put this...
P2: (laughs) Take your time, I'm intrigued.
P1: Right, so Karen was trying to "express herself" through interpretive dance in the break room.
P2: (concerned) Wait, what? Is she okay? Was she having some kind of episode?
P1: (amused) No, no, it was totally intentional. She said she was "releasing office tension" or something.
P2: (still concerned) That's... quite something. Did people stop to watch?
P1: (chuckles) Oh, yeah! The whole office was staring. I think Dave from accounting was actually crying... from laughter, I hope.
