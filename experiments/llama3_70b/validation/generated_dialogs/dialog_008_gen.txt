P1: Hey, I'm trying to think of a birthday gift for Emma. Do you have any ideas?
P2: Oh, yeah! I was just talking to her the other day, actually. What's your budget looking like?
P1: Uh, I don't know... maybe around fifty bucks? Hmm, is that enough?
P2: Yeah, that's definitely doable. So, Emma's really into that whole wellness thing, right?
