P1: Oh man, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What? What happened? You're killing me!
P1: Hmm, so I was at my desk, just doing some work, when suddenly...
P2: (interrupting) Wait, was it during the meeting?
P1: No, no, it was after. So, I was at my desk, and our CEO walks in...
P2: (surprised) The CEO? What was he doing there?
P1: (laughs) Yeah, I know, right? So, he walks in and starts yelling at John...
P2: (gasping) No way! What did John do?
P1: Apparently, John "accidentally" booked the conference room for his birthday party... on a workday!
P2: (laughs) That's insane! Did the CEO freak out?
P1: (chuckles) Yeah, he was not happy. But the best part is, John had no idea it was a problem...
P2: (amazed) And? What happened next?
P1: Well, the CEO just told him to cancel the party and get back to work. It was pretty funny, actually.
P2: (laughs) I wish I was there! Did anyone take a video?
P1: (laughs) Yeah, Sarah got a few seconds on her phone. I'll send it to you later.
P2: (excited) Do it! I need to see this!
