P1: Hey, I got the news about the job I applied for. 
P2: Oh, yeah? How did it go?
P1: Uh, didn't get it. But I'm not gonna let it get me down, you know?
P2: Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be really disappointed.
P1: Yeah, I was pretty stoked about the opportunity, but... I mean, it's not the end of the world, right?
P2: Absolutely not. You're strong, and you'll find something even better. What did they say was the reason, if you don't mind me asking?
