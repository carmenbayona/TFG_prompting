P1: Oh no, I'm freaking out, I think I lost my wallet. I had it at the coffee shop, and now it's gone.
P2: Ah, that's terrible! When did you realize it was missing?
P1: Uh, like, an hour ago? I was getting ready to leave and I reached for my wallet to grab some cash, and it wasn't there.
P2: Okay, let's think this through. Did you check your pockets, your bag, everywhere?
P1: Yeah, I've checked everywhere. I even went back to the coffee shop and asked if anyone had turned it in, but no luck.
P2: Hmm, did you have any ID or credit cards in there?
P1: Yeah, my license, credit cards, some cash... everything. I'm so worried someone's gonna use my identity or something.
P2: Okay, first things first, let's cancel your credit cards. Do you have the numbers written down somewhere?
