P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: Try me, what's going on?
P1: So, someone, uh, accidentally set the fire alarm off during lunch.
P2: Oh no, was everyone evacuated?
P1: Yeah, we all had to go outside, but the funniest part is... 
P2: Wait, was it on purpose or just a mistake?
P1: No, no, it was a mistake. Apparently, John from HR tried to heat up a fish stick in the microwave... 
P2: Ew, gross! Did it cause any damage?
P1: Nah, just a lot of smoke and a bunch of annoyed people. But hey, we got a nice break from work.
