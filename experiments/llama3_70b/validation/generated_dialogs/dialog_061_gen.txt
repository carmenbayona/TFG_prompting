P1: Hey, how's the project coming along? I feel like it's been ages since we last caught up.

P2: Ah, it's going great, really great. We're right on track to meet the deadline.

P1: That's awesome! I was a bit worried, you know, with all the changes we made last minute.

P2: Yeah, I know what you mean. But we've got a good team, they've been working hard to get everything sorted out.

P2: So, I was thinking, for the presentation, we could... 

P1: Wait, wait, sorry, what presentation? I thought we were just doing a progress report.

P2: Oh, no, no, I'm sure we decided on a full presentation. Don't you remember? 

P1: Hmm, I don't know... maybe I missed that meeting. What's the presentation about, exactly?

P2: Well, it's just a general overview of the project, where we are, what we've accomplished... you know, the usual.

P1: Okay, cool. And how's the prep going for that? Do we have all the materials we need?

P2: Yeah, we're all set. I've got the slides, the graphs, everything. We're good to go.
