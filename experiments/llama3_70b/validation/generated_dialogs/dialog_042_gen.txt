P1: Ugh, I'm so sick of this traffic, I've been stuck on this highway for like an hour.
P2: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, that sounds really frustrating.
P1: Frustrating? It's infuriating! I'm gonna be late for work again because of this stupid roadwork.
P2: Hmm, yeah, I remember they started construction on that highway a few months ago, didn't they?
P1: Few months ago? It feels like they've been working on it for years! And it's not even like it's making a difference, the traffic is still terrible.
P2: Yeah, that's true... I've heard it's supposed to be finished by the summer, though.
P1: Summer? That's three months away! I need a solution now, not in three months.
P2: I totally get it, I would be really upset too... Have you thought about taking the side roads or leaving a little earlier?
P1: Side roads? You think I haven't tried that? They're all jammed up too... And leaving earlier just means I'll be sitting in traffic for longer.
P2: Yeah, that makes sense... Okay, well, what if you tried carpooling or taking public transportation?
P1: Hmm, I don't know... I've thought about it, but I don't really know anyone who lives nearby to carpool with... And the bus takes forever.
P2: Yeah, that's true... But maybe you could look into it a bit more, see if there are any options that might work for you?
