P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.
P2: What's going on? You're grinning from ear to ear.
P1: Okay, so uh, Karen from HR spilled coffee all over the conference room table.
P2: (laughs) Oh my god, that's hilarious! Was it during a meeting?
P1: Yeah, and it was like, the most important meeting of the quarter. I mean, our CEO was there...
P2: (still laughing) Oh man, that's... that's amazing. Was Karen really upset about it?
P1: Hmm, actually, she was surprisingly calm. I think she was more worried about the CEO's reaction.
P2: Yeah, that makes sense. But what about the CEO? How did he take it?
P1: (chuckles) Well, he just kinda... shrugged it off. Said something like, "Accidents happen, let's focus on the presentation."
P2: Wow, I'm impressed. I would've expected him to freak out. Did the meeting still go okay?
P1: Yeah, it did. Although, we had to move to the other conference room. And, of course, everyone was snickering and whispering about it.
P2: (laughs) I can imagine. That must've been really distracting. Were you able to focus at all?
P1: (laughs) Honestly, it was hard not to keep thinking about it. But I think we managed to get the important stuff covered.
