P1: So, we need to get started on this group project, right? We've got a lot to cover.
P2: Yeah, I'm really excited about it. What's the plan, then?
P1: Okay, so first, we need to decide on a topic. Uh, I was thinking maybe something related to climate change?
P2: Hmm, that's a great idea. But, wait, didn't our prof say we have to choose from a list of approved topics?
P1: Oh, yeah, you're right. I forgot about that. Let me check the syllabus real quick... (pause) Okay, yeah, it looks like we can choose from three topics: climate change, sustainable energy, or environmental policy.
P2: Okay, cool. So, which one do you think we should go with?
