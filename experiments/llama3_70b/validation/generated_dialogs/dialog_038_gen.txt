P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened in the office yesterday.
P2: What is it? You're kind of freaking me out.
P1: Oh, no, it's not bad, it's just... uh, so ridiculous. 
P2: Okay, spill it.
P1: Alright, so Karen from HR tripped on the stairs and spilled coffee all over the CEO's shirt.
P2: (laughs) No way! Was it a big deal?
P1: Yeah, huge. I mean, he was pretty calm about it, but you could tell he was seething. 
P2: Hmm, I bet. And what about Karen? Was she mortified?
P1: Totally. I felt so bad for her. I think she might've even cried in the bathroom for a bit.
P2: Aw, poor thing. Do you think she'll be okay? Was it an accident or...?
P1: Oh, totally an accident. Just one of those clumsy moments. 
P2: Yeah, we've all been there. So, did the CEO yell at her or anything?
P1: No, no, like I said, he was pretty cool about it. Just told her to be more careful next time.
