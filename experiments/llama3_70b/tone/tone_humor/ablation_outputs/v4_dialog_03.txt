P1: Oh, I have the most amazing surprise for you! Pack a bag, we're going on an adventure!
P2: What kind of adventure? And where are we going?
P1: Ah, ah, ah, no questions! Just trust me, it'll be incredible!
P2: You're being super suspicious. Are you kidnapping me?
P1: Ha! No, I promise it's nothing sinister. Although, I did book us a very... exotic destination.
P2: Exotic?! You mean like a third-world country where they'll sell my organs on the black market?!
P1: *accidentally* Oh, no, no, it's not that kind of exotic. I mean, it's got palm trees and... *coughs*... anyway, just pack the bag!
P2: Palm trees?! You're taking me to Hawaii, aren't you?! Wait, is this some kind of prank?!
P1: *laughs nervously* Uh, no, it's not Hawaii. And it's definitely not a prank. I just really want it to be a surprise, okay?
P2: Fine, but if I end up on a reality TV show or in a hostage situation, I'm blaming you!
