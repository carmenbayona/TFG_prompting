P1: Oh, hey! I need you to pack a bag for a few days, like, right now.
P2: What? Why? Where are we going?
P1: Hmm, just trust me on this one. It'll be a surprise!
P2: You're not trying to kidnap me, are you?
P1: Uh, no! Of course not! I swear, it's a good surprise. You'll love it.
P2: Okay, but how do I know it's not some prank? You're being super weird.
P1: I'm not being weird! I'm just... enthusiastic. Yeah, that's it. Enthusiastic.
P2: Enthusiastic? You're practically bouncing off the walls. What's going on?
