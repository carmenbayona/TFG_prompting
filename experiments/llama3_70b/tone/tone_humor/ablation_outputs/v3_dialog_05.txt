P1: Oh, man! I've got an amazing surprise for you!
P2: What is it? Did you finally win the lottery or something?
P1: (laughs) No, no, it's even better than that! Just pack a bag, trust me.
P2: Pack a bag? For what? Are you kidnapping me?
P1: (laughs) No, no, I promise! It's a trip, and you'll love it.
P2: A trip where? Is it one of those "surprise, you're going to a timeshare presentation" things?
P1: (accidentally) Okay, fine, it's... (pauses) wait, no! I didn't say that out loud!
P2: What didn't you say out loud?! You're freaking me out, dude!
P1: (laughs) Just... just forget it, okay? You'll see when we get there, I swear!
P2: (suddenly paranoid) Get where?! Are we even going to the same place?!
