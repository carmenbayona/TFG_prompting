P1: Oh, I almost forgot! Pack a bag, we're leaving tomorrow morning! 
P2: What? Where are we going? Is this some kind of prank? 
P1: No, no, no! It's a surprise! You'll love it, I promise! 
P2: A surprise? You know I hate surprises! Unless... unless you're kidnapping me?
P1: (laughs) Of course not! It's just a little getaway. You need a break, trust me.
P2: Wait, how long is this "little getaway"? And what's with the weird smile?
P1: (accidentally) Oh, we'll be near the beach... I mean, it's just a figure of speech! 
P2: (alarmed) The beach?! You're taking me to the beach?! Are you planning to drown me?!
