P1: Hey, pack a bag, we're going on a surprise trip!
P2: What? No way. You're not kidnapping me, are you?
P1: Ha! No, of course not. It's a fun surprise, I promise.
P2: Like a scavenger hunt where the final clue is a deserted island?
P1: Um, no... nothing like that. Just trust me, okay?
P2: Trust you? You're being super sketchy. Is it a prank?
P1: I swear it's not a prank! You'll love it, I just... uh... need to get you to the airport.
P2: The airport? So we're leaving the country? Are we going to a war zone?
