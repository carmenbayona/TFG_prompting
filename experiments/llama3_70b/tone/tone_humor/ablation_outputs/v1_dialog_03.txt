P1: Oh man, I have the most amazing surprise for you! You have to pack a bag, like, right now!
P2: What's going on? Are you kidnapping me or something?
P1: Ha! No, of course not! You'll just have to trust me on this one. 
P2: Trust you? You're being super shady right now. Where are we going?
P1: Uh, I can't tell you that just yet. Let's just say it's going to be an adventure!
P2: An adventure? You're really not helping your case here. How do I know this isn't some prank gone wrong?
P1: Hmm, well... I might have said something about a beach... Oops, did I say that out loud?
P2: A beach? So you're taking me to the beach? Which beach?! Is it somewhere with an extradition treaty?!
P1: Oh, stop it! You're being ridiculous! Just pack your bag and let's go! We'll leave in an hour!
P2: Fine, but if I end up on some reality TV show, I'm blaming you!
