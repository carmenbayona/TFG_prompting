P1: Oh, dude, I need you to pack a bag, like, ASAP! We're going on an adventure!
P2: What? What's going on? Are you pranking me?
P1: No way, I'm totally serious! You'll love it, I promise! Just... just trust me, okay?
P2: Trust you? You're being super weird. Is this some kind of intervention or something?
P1: Haha, no, no, no! It's just... uh... a surprise. Yeah, that's it! A surprise trip!
P2: A surprise trip? To where? How long? What's the plan?
P1: Oh, you know, just... hmm... a little getaway. You'll see when we get there! *accidentally whispers* Beach...
P2: What was that? Did you just say "beach"? Are we going to the beach? Wait, are you kidnapping me?!
P1: Shh, no, no, no! I didn't say that! You didn't hear that! It's just... uh... a... a... a mountain lodge! Yeah, that's it!
P2: A mountain lodge? With a beach?! You're the worst liar ever!
