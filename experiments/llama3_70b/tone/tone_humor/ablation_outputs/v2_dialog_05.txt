P1: Hey, I need you to pack a bag for a surprise trip!
P2: What? No way, what's going on? You're not, like, kidnapping me, are you?
P1: Haha, no, of course not! It's just a fun surprise, trust me!
P2: Trust you? You're being super secretive, which only makes me think you're up to no good...
P1: Okay, okay, I'll give you a tiny hint... we're going somewhere warm...
P2: Warm? That's it? You're not even giving me a climate zone?! Is it, like, the desert? Are you selling me to a cult?!
P1: Uh, no... and, hmm, I might have said too much already...
P2: Oh, so now you're slipping up and giving me clues?! Spill the beans, what's the surprise?!
