Here is the dialog:

P1: Oh, dude! I need you to pack a small bag for a surprise trip! Just trust me, it'll be epic!
P2: Wait, what? No way! You're not gonna kidnap me or something, are you?
P1: Haha, no! Of course not! I just want it to be a surprise, you know?
P2: Uh-huh... So, how long is this "surprise" trip? A week? A month?
P1: Hmm, let's just say... it's shorter than a month. Pack for... um, a few days.
P2: A few days?! You're being super vague here! Is it a secret mission or something?
P1: Oh, man, you're being paranoid! It's just a fun little getaway, I swear! *accidentally* mentions "beach" under his breath...
P2: WHAT WAS THAT?! DID YOU JUST SAY "BEACH"?! IS THIS A BEACH TRIP?! TELL ME!
