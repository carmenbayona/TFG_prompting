P1: Oh man, I have the most amazing surprise for you!
P2: What is it? Did you win the lottery or something?
P1: Haha, no, nothing like that... but trust me, you're going to love it! Just pack a bag, and we'll be good to go!
P2: Wait, what? Where are we going? Is this some kind of prank?
P1: Hmm, no, it's not a prank, I swear! You'll just have to... uh... have faith in me, yeah?
P2: Faith in you? You're being super suspicious. Are you kidnapping me or something?
P1: No, no, no! Nothing like that, I promise! It's just... a fun adventure! *accidentally whispers* Beach...
P2: What was that? Did you say beach? Are we going to the beach?
P1: *nervously laughs* Oh, no, no, no! I didn't say that! You must have misheard! Just... just pack a swimsuit, okay?
