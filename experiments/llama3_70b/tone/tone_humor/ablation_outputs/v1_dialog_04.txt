P1: Oh man, I have the most amazing surprise for you! 
P2: What's going on? You're being super weird. 
P1: We're going on a trip! Just pack a bag, trust me, it'll be epic! 
P2: Wait, what? Where are we going? 
P1: Hmm, I didn't say we were going anywhere specific... uh, just... a place. 
P2: You're not, like, kidnapping me, are you? 
P1: What? No! Of course not! Although, I did have to sign a non-disclosure agreement about the destination... 
P2: A non-disclosure agreement? Who does that?! You're freaking me out, dude! 
P1: Okay, okay, I might've said too much. Just... just think of it as an adventure! And, uh, pack warm clothes.
