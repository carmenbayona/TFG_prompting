P1: OMG, pack a bag, we're going on an adventure!
P2: What? Where? How long? What's going on?!
P1: Uh, just trust me, it'll be epic! You'll love it, I promise!
P2: This is some kind of prank, right? You're not gonna kidnap me or something?
P1: Haha, no, no, no! It's just a surprise, okay? You'll figure it out when we get there... hmm, I mean...
P2: Wait, what did you just say? "When we get there"? Where is "there"?! You're killing me, dude!
P1: Okay, okay, I'll give you a tiny hint: it's not in the country. But that's all I'm saying!
P2: Not in the country?! Are you taking me to some secret island or something?! Am I gonna need a passport?!
P1: *accidentally* mentions " customs"... Shh, never mind! Just pack, okay?
