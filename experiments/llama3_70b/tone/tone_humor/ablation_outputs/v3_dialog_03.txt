P1: Oh, hey! I need you to pack a bag for a surprise trip!
P2: What? Why? Is this a kidnapping? 
P1: Haha, no! It's a total surprise, you'll love it, I promise! 
P2: That's what kidnappers say. How long do I need to pack for? 
P1: Uh, just a few days... or so. You'll see!
P2: A few days?! Are we going to a remote island or something? 
P1: (laughs) Maybe... Okay, no, not an island. (pauses) Oh, wait, I wasn't supposed to say that! 
P2: (skeptical) What do you mean you weren't supposed to say that?! You're freaking me out, dude!
