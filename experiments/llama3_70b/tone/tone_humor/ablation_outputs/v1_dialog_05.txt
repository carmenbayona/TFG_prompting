P1: Oh man, I've got the most amazing surprise for you!
P2: What's going on? You're being super weird.
P1: Weird? Me? Never! I'm just... excited. Yeah, that's it.
P2: Excited about what? Did you finally win the lottery or something?
P1: Uh, no... It's just a little trip I've planned. You'll love it, I promise!
P2: A trip? Where? When? How long? Spill the beans!
P1: Hmm, well... I want it to be a surprise. Can't you just trust me?
P2: Trust you? You're being super shady right now. Are you kidnapping me?
P1: What? No! Of course not! It's just a fun little getaway. You'll see... (accidentally) It's got palm trees... 
P2: Palm trees?! You're taking me to Hawaii or something?! Wait, is this some kind of prank? Are you punking me?!
