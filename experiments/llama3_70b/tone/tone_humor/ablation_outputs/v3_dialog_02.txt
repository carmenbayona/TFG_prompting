P1: Oh, I almost forgot! I need you to pack a bag for a surprise trip tonight.
P2: What? Where are we going? Is this some kind of prank?
P1: (laughs) You'll just have to trust me on this one. It's going to be amazing!
P2: (skeptical) Trust you? You're not even giving me a hint. What if it's a kidnapping?
P1: (accidentally) Okay, fine. Let's just say... it's somewhere warm.
P2: (excitedly) Wait, is it Hawaii?! Tell me it's Hawaii!
P1: (quickly covering) No, no, no. It's not Hawaii. Just... warm. Yeah.
P2: (paranoid) This is exactly how they start, isn't it? "Pack a bag, don't ask questions." Next thing I know, I'm on a cargo ship to Timbuktu.
P1: (reassuringly) I promise you, it's not Timbuktu. Just pack the bag, okay? You can trust me.
