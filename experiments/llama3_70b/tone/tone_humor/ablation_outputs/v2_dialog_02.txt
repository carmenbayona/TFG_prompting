P1: Oh, dude, I have the most epic surprise for you!
P2: What is it? Did you finally get tickets to that concert I've been bugging you about?
P1: Uh, no... it's way better than that! You just need to trust me and pack a bag for the weekend.
P2: Pack a bag? What, are you kidnapping me or something? 
P1: Ha! No, no, no! It's just... hmm, how do I put this... it's a surprise, okay? Just bring your passport, and... oh, and a swimsuit.
P2: A swimsuit? You're not taking me to some weird underwater lair, are you? 
P1: (laughs) No, no lair! I promise! You'll just... uh, appreciate the view, okay? 
P2: The view? You're being super cryptic, dude. Is this some kind of prank? Am I gonna end up on YouTube or something?
P1: (laughs nervously) No, no, no prank! I swear! Just... just go with it, okay?
