P1: Okay, so when are we going on this trip again? I feel like we talked about it, but I totally forgot.
P2: *sigh* We've been over this, like, five times already. We're going next Friday.
P1: Next Friday? But I could've sworn we said the week after... Uh, did you check the email with the hotel reservation?
P2: Yeah, I checked it. It's all good. We have a room booked from Friday to Sunday. You need to start paying attention, man.
P1: Hmm, I'm pretty sure I replied to that email saying we wanted to change the dates... Did you check my sent emails?
P2: *exasperated laugh* No, I didn't check your sent emails. Look, just trust me, okay? I've got this under control. We're all set for next Friday.
P1: Alright, alright... But if we get there and they're like, "Uh, you're a week early," I'm blaming you.
P2: *laughs* That's the plan. Now, can we move on to something else? Like, have you packed anything yet?
