P1: Hey, how's it going? You've been missing from the gym for a while, what's up?
P2: *sigh* I don't know, man. I just got lazy, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm getting any younger...
P1: Ah, come on! You're not that old! Besides, it's not about being young, it's about being consistent. You were doing so well, what happened?
P2: Honestly, I just got discouraged. I was trying to do too much too soon, and I ended up burning out. I'm just not good at this whole "working out" thing...
P1: That's not true! You were crushing it! Okay, fine, maybe you did try to do too much. But we can fix that. Let's make a plan to start small, okay? Like, really small. We can start with, I don't know, five push-ups a day or something.
