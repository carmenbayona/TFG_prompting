P1: Hey, how's the thesis going? You've been pretty quiet about it lately.
P2: Ugh, it's a nightmare. I don't even know where to start anymore. I feel like I've been staring at the same paragraph for weeks.
P1: Hmm, that doesn't sound like you. What's going on? Is it the research or the writing that's got you stuck?
P2: Honestly, I think it's the methodology. I mean, I thought I had it figured out, but the more I read, the more I realize I have no idea what I'm doing. And my advisor's not being super helpful, either.
