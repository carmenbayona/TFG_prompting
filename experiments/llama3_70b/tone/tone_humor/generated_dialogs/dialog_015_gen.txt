P1: Dude, I could've sworn you said you booked our train tickets for this weekend.
P2: Uh, no, I don't think so... I mean, I was gonna do it, but then I got busy with work.
P1: Busy with work? You're always busy with work! That's just your excuse for not doing stuff. You're like the king of procrastination.
P2: Hey, that's not fair! I do plenty of stuff. And besides, I thought you were gonna book the tickets. I could've sworn you said you'd take care of it.
