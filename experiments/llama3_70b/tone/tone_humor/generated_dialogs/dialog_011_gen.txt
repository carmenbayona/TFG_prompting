P1: Hey, have you seen my phone charger? I could've sworn I left it right here on the couch.
P2: Hmm, nope, haven't seen it. You're not going crazy, though... I think.
P1: What do you mean "you're not going crazy, though"? That's not reassuring at all!
P2: Oh, sorry, I was just trying to be funny. But seriously, let's look around. When was the last time you remember using it?
P1: Um, I think it was this morning when I was getting ready for work. I'm pretty sure I plugged it in right here...
P2: Okay, so it couldn't have walked off on its own, right? Unless... unless you have a mischievous pet we don't know about?
P1: Ha! Yeah, no, no pets. But seriously, I'm starting to freak out a little. Without my phone, I'm lost.
P2: Okay, stay calm, we'll find it. Let me check the kitchen real quick. Sometimes things migrate there mysteriously.
P1: The kitchen? What would my charger be doing in the kitchen? You're not helping!
P2: Hey, don't knock it till we try it! I'll be right back. (pauses) Okay, I was wrong, it's not in the kitchen. But I did find a half-eaten sandwich from last week...
P1: (laughs) What?! You were just messing with me, weren't you?! The kitchen was just a wild goose chase!
P2: (laughs) Maybe, maybe. But hey, at least we ruled out the kitchen, right? Now, let's try to think this through. Where else could it be?
P1: (sighs) Okay, fine. Let's try to think this through. But if we don't find it, I'm blaming you and your kitchen detour!
