P1: Hey, what's up for movie night? I was thinking we could do something light, you know, not too scary.
P2: Oh, come on! Scary movies are the best! We should totally watch The Shining or something.
P1: Uh, I don't know... I'm not really in the mood for a horror movie. How about a rom-com instead?
P2: Rom-com?! You want to watch something that's gonna put me to sleep! We need something with some action, some thrills! Have you seen that new Marvel movie?
P1: Hmm, I don't know... I've been meaning to see it, but isn't it like, three hours long? And what about snacks? We can't watch a movie without snacks!
