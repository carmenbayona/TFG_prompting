P1: Hey, finally got my thesis draft done! Want to take a look and give me some feedback?

P2: Yeah, sure thing! I'd love to help. But don't expect me to be too nice, I'm gonna rip it apart.

P1: Haha, bring it on! I can take it. So, what's the first thing that caught your attention?

P2: Okay, so the literature review... uh, how can I put this nicely... it's a bit of a hot mess.

P1: Yeah, I knew it was weak. I just couldn't seem to get a grip on all the research out there. Did I at least get the main points across?

P2: Hmm, sort of. You've got the main ideas, but it's all over the place. You need to organize it better and make it flow. Maybe make an outline or something.

P1: Yeah, that makes sense. I was thinking of just winging it, but I guess that didn't work out so well.
