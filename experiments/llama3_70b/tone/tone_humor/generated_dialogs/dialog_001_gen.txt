P1: Hey, don't forget we have that important meeting tomorrow at 2 PM!
P2: Meeting? What meeting?
P1: Uh, the one we've been preparing for weeks? You're kidding, right?
P2: Hmm, I don't know... might've slipped my mind. Maybe I wrote it down somewhere...
P1: (laughs) You're such a jokester! Seriously, though, you need to be there. It's crucial for the project.
P2: Okay, okay, I'll try to remember. But if I don't show up, it's not my fault. You're always reminding me about stuff â€“ it's like you're my personal secretary!
