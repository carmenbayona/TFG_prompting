P1: Hey, have you noticed the sink in the kitchen is leaking like crazy?
P2: Oh, yeah! I saw that this morning. It's not that bad, is it?
P1: Not that bad?! There's a mini-geyser going on in there! We need to get it fixed ASAP.
P2: Hmmm... yeah, I guess it's a good idea. But can we do it after dinner? I was thinking of making your favorite pasta tonight.
P1: (sighs) Fine, after dinner it is. But if the kitchen floods while we're eating, don't say I didn't warn you!
