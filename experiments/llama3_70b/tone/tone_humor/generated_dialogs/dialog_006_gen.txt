P1: Hey, Doc, I've been feeling really crummy lately. I've got this weird rash on my arm and I'm always tired.
P2: Ah, sorry to hear that! Let's take a look. *examines rash* Hmm, that does look a bit unusual. When did you first notice it?
P1: Uh, I think it started a few weeks ago. And the fatigue... I don't know, it feels like I've been running on empty for months. You think it's something serious?
P2: *chuckles* Well, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I'm sure it's just... uh... *pauses*... your body's way of telling you to take a few more naps. *smirks*
P1: *laughs nervously* Yeah, yeah, I guess I have been burning the candle at both ends. But what about the rash? Is it, like, contagious or something?
P2: Oh, don't worry about that. It's probably just an allergic reaction to... hmm... *thinks for a moment*... to life in general. *winks*
