P1: Hey, have you noticed the internet is super slow today? 
P2: Ugh, slow? It's not even working for me! I've been trying to get online for hours.
P1: Hmm, that's weird. I was just watching YouTube and it kept buffering. Did you try restarting the router?
P2: Of course, I did! Like, five times already. It's not the router, it's the stupid internet provider. They're always having issues.
