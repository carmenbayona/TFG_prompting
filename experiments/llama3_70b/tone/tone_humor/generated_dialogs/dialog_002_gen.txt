P1: Dude, I'm getting a little frustrated here. You said you booked our flights to Vegas, but I just checked and there's no record of it.
P2: Oh, wait, I'm so sorry... I think I might have forgotten to hit "confirm" on the website. 
P1: You think?! You think?! You're always doing this, dude! Leaving me to clean up after your forgetfulness.
P2: Hey, I said I was sorry! And it's not like I'm not willing to fix it. I'll just... uh... log back in and... hmm... yeah.
P1: "Hmm yeah"? What's that even supposed to mean? You're not exactly filling me with confidence here. 
P2: Okay, okay, I get it. I messed up. But can I just ask, why didn't you remind me to book the flights? I thought we were sharing responsibility on this trip.
P1: Because, my friend, I thought we had an understanding. You said you'd take care of the flights, and I'd handle the hotel. But noooo, you had to go and... never mind. Just fix it, please.
