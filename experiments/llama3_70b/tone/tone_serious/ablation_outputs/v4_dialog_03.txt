P1: I just got my exam results and I'm really disappointed. I failed by a small margin.

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you score overall?

P1: (interrupting) And I just don't understand why I did so badly! I studied really hard for weeks.

P2: (calmly) Okay, let's take a step back. Tell me, what do you think went wrong during the exam?

P1: (frustrated) I don't know... maybe I just panicked. But it's not fair, I was so prepared! (starts to change topic) You know, I've been thinking about taking a different course next semester...

P2: (gently) Hold on, let's focus on this exam for now. We can discuss other options later. Have you considered repeating the course? Sometimes it helps to retake it with a fresh perspective.
