P1: I just got my exam results and... I didn't pass. I'm really struggling to understand why.

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind right now?

P1: (interrupting) I mean, I studied so hard, I attended all the lectures, I did all the assignments... I just don't get it. What did I do wrong?

P2: Okay, let's take a step back. Maybe we can go through your study habits together and see if there's anything we can identify that might have contributed to this.

P1: (suddenly changing topic) Do you think I should just repeat the course? I mean, it's not like I have a choice, right? I need to pass it to graduate.

P2: (calmly) Well, repeating the course is definitely an option, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's focus on understanding what happened this time around, and then we can discuss the best course of action.
