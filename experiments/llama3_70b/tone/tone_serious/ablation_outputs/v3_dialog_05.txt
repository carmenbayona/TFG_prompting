P1: (nervously) I just got my exam results... and I didn't pass. 
P2: (calmly) I'm so sorry to hear that. Can I see the results with you? 
P1: (interrupting) Wait, what was the curve on this exam? Was it really low? 
P2: (pausing briefly) Actually, the curve was quite generous. But let's take a closer look at your results... 
P1: (changing the subject) You know, I was thinking, maybe I should just repeat the entire course. Would that be crazy? 
P2: (reassuringly) Not at all. Repeating the course might be a good idea, but let's not jump to conclusions. Let me help you go over the results and we can identify areas where you need improvement.

In this dialog, P1 is worried and stressed about their exam results, while P2 remains calm and supportive. P1's goal is to understand why they failed, while P2's goal is to comfort and support P1. The conversation touches on the subplot of repeating the course, and imperfections such as P1 interrupting P2 and changing the topic out of stress are present.
