P1: I-I don't understand how I failed. I studied so hard for this exam.

P2: Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your experience during the exam? What did you think of the questions?

P1: (interrupting) Wait, no, I don't want to talk about the exam questions. I want to know why I didn't pass. What did I do wrong?

P2: Okay, let's take a step back. From what I see, you were close to passing, but... (pauses) you struggled with the essay section.

P1: (nervously) Oh, yeah... I knew that was a weak spot for me. But I thought I had improved... (trails off) Do you think I should retake the course?

P2: Hmm, that's definitely an option. But before we jump into that, let's discuss what you can do to improve your essay writing skills. We can set up some extra tutoring sessions...

P1: (changing topic out of stress) You know, my friend who took the exam with me passed. I wonder what they did differently... (sighs) Maybe I'm just not cut out for this.
