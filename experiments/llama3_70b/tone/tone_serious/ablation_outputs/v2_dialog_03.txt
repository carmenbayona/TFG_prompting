P1: I-I just can't believe I failed. I studied so hard for that exam.

P2: Hey, it's okay. Let's take a look at the results together and see where you went wrong.

P1: (interrupting) No, no, it's not okay. I feel like such a failure. I was so sure I had it in the bag.

P2: (calmly) I know you're upset, but we can work through this. Did you notice any areas where you struggled on the exam?

P1: (suddenly changing topic) Do you think I should just repeat the course? I mean, maybe I just wasn't ready for it.

P2: Well, repeating the course is definitely an option. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Can we focus on understanding what went wrong this time around?
