P1: (nervously) I don't understand how I did so poorly on the exam. I studied for weeks.  
P2: (calmly) Let's take a look at the results together. Sometimes it's not just about the amount of studying, but how you approach the material.  
P1: (interrupting) But I felt so confident going in. I thought for sure I'd passed. (starts to get flustered) What if I'm just not cut out for this?  
P2: (soothingly) Hey, let's not jump to conclusions. We can review the exam questions and see where you went wrong. (pauses as P1 nods) You know, repeating the course might not be a bad idea. You could use a refresher on the material.  
P1: (changing topic suddenly) Do you think the professor will curve the grades? Maybe that'll help me pass.  
P2: (gently) I don't think that's likely, but we can talk to the professor about it. First, let's focus on understanding what you need to work on. (pauses) You're not alone in this, and we can get through it together.  
P1: (sighs) You're right. I just feel so frustrated with myself.  
P2: (supportively) I know it's tough, but you'll get there. We'll work on a study plan and make sure you're better prepared for the next exam.
