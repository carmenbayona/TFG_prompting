Here is the generated conversation:

P1: I... I don't understand why I failed the exam. I studied so hard.

P2: I know you did, and I'm proud of the effort you put in. Let's take a closer look at the results and see where we can improve.

P1: (interrupting) But what's the point of looking at the results? I've already failed. I'll never get into the program I want.

P2: (calmly) Okay, let's take a deep breath and focus on the present. We can discuss repeating the course, and I think that's a great option.

P1: (pausing, stress evident) Yeah... yeah, maybe you're right. But what if I fail again? (hesitates) I don't know if I can handle it.

P2: You won't be alone, and we'll work together to ensure you're better prepared. We can also explore additional resources to help you succeed. You're not defined by one exam result, and you have so much potential.
