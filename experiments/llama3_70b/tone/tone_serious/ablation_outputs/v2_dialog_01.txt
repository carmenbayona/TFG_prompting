P1: I-I don't understand, I studied so hard for that exam. How did I manage to fail?

P2: Hey, it's okay. Let's take a look at your results together and see if we can figure out what went wrong.

P1: (interrupting) But I knew the material inside and out! I'm just so... so frustrated with myself.

P2: I can imagine. It's tough to see all your hard work not pay off. But sometimes it's not just about knowing the material. Maybe we can talk about your test-taking strategies...

P1: (changing topic) You know, I was thinking, maybe I should just repeat the course. Start fresh and try to do better next time.

P2: Well, that's definitely an option. But before we jump into that, can we take a step back and look at what specifically went wrong this time around?
