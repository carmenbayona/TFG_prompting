P1: I just got my exam results and I'm really upset. I don't understand how I failed. Can you help me go over what happened?

P2: Of course, I'm here for you. Let's take a look at the results together. What do you think went wrong?

P1: (interrupting) I studied so hard, I really did. I don't know what else I could've done differently.

P2: (calmly) Okay, let's take a deep breath and go through this step by step. Can you tell me a little more about your study habits leading up to the exam?

P1: (changing topic) You know, I was thinking maybe I should just repeat the course. Do you think that's a good idea?

P2: Well, repeating the course might be a good option, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's focus on understanding what went wrong this time around, and then we can discuss our next steps.
