P1: (nervously) I just saw the exam results... I didn't pass.  
P2: (calmly) I'm sorry to hear that. What are your thoughts on what happened?  
P1: (interrupting) I just don't get it! I studied so hard. (stops suddenly) Wait, was the exam curved?  
P2: (patiently) Actually, it wasn't. But let me take a look at your results with you... (starts to explain)  
P1: (changing topic) You know, I was thinking about dropping the course anyway. I don't know if I'm cut out for it.  
P2: (supportively) Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. We can go over the material again, and I can give you some additional resources to help you prepare. Would you like that?  
P1: (hesitantly) Yeah... I guess so. Would repeating the course really make a difference?  
P2: (encouragingly) Absolutely. You can learn from your mistakes and come back stronger. I'll be here to support you every step of the way.
