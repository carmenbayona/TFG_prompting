P1: I-I just got my exam results and... I didn't pass. I'm really worried about what this means for my future.

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened? What did the results say exactly?

P1: (interrupting) Oh, it just said I didn't meet the requirements. But I studied so hard! I don't understand what I did wrong.

P2: Okay, let's take a step back. Sometimes these things happen, and it's not the end of the world. Have you thought about talking to your professor about what you can do differently next time?

P1: (nervously) Yeah, I guess so... But what if I'm just not cut out for this? What if I'm not smart enough? (starts to get emotional)

P2: (calmly) Hey, that's not true. You are capable. And if you need to, you can repeat the course. We can work through this together.
