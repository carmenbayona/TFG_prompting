P1: I-I just can't believe it. I studied so hard for that exam, and I still failed. (pauses) What did I do wrong?

P2: Well, let's take a look at your results together. Sometimes, it's not about how hard you studied, but about how effectively you prepared. 

P1: (interrupting) But I did everything you told me to do! I attended all the lectures, I did all the assignments... I just don't get it. (sighs) 

P2: I know, I know. It's frustrating. But we can work through this. Can you tell me more about how you approached the exam questions? Maybe we can identify some areas for improvement.

P1: (hesitates) I... I don't know. I just felt so overwhelmed when I saw the questions. I started to panic, and... (trails off) Oh, wait, can I ask, is it possible to repeat the course?

P2: Ah, yes, that's definitely an option. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's go through your results and see what we can learn from them. Then we can discuss the possibility of repeating the course.
