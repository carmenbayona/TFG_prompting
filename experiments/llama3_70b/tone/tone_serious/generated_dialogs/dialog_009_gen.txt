P1: I've been looking over our travel plans, and I wanted to confirm the details with you. We're still set to arrive on Friday, correct?
P2: (sighing) Yes, that's what I thought, but I just got an email from the hotel saying our reservation is only for Thursday night.
P1: That's strange. I could've sworn I booked it for two nights. Let me check my email to verify.
P2: (impatiently) You should have done that before! Now we have a conflict with our meeting schedule on Friday morning.
