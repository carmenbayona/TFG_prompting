P1: Hi, have you seen my phone charger? I can't seem to find it anywhere.
P2: Ah, sorry to hear that. I was just in the kitchen making some breakfast, didn't see it there. 
P1: Hmm, I could've sworn I left it right here on the counter. Are you sure you didn't see it when you were getting your coffee?
P2: No, I didn't notice it, but I was a bit distracted thinking about my meeting this morning. Let me help you search the living room, maybe it fell behind the couch or something.
