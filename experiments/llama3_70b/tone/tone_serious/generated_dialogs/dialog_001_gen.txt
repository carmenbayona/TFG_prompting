P1: I wanted to touch base with you about the upcoming meeting on Friday. It's crucial that all team members are present.
P2: (nervous pause) Ah, yes... the meeting. I'll make sure to be there.
P1: I've noticed you've missed a few meetings recently, and I'm concerned it might happen again. Can you assure me you'll attend this one?
P2: I apologize for my past absences. I've just been... really busy lately. (nervous pause) But I'll definitely be there on Friday.
P1: I appreciate your apology, but I need more than just a promise. Can you commit to attending and actively participating in the meeting?
