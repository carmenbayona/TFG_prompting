P1: Doctor, I've been experiencing some chest pains lately, especially when I exert myself. I'm getting really worried.
P2: I see. Can you tell me more about the pains? Are they sharp, dull, or a feeling of pressure?
P1: Um, I...I think it's more like a pressure. It's hard to describe. (pauses) Sometimes it feels like there's a weight on my chest.
P2: I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue?
P1: Yes, I have been feeling a bit short of breath lately. But I thought it was just because I'm out of shape. Could it be something serious, like a heart condition?
