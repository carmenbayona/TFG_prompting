P1: Hey, I was thinking we could have a movie night this weekend. What do you think?
P2: That sounds like a great idea. I'm really open to whatever type of movie you're in the mood for.
P1: Awesome. I was thinking maybe an action movie? We could watch the new Marvel film.
P2: Uh, I don't know... I'm not really sure if I'm in the mood for a superhero movie. How about a horror movie instead?
P2: Oh, wait, no, I mean... I'm not sure if I want to watch a horror movie either. What about a rom-com?
