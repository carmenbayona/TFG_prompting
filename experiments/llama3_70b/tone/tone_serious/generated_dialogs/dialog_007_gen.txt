P1: Hi there, I wanted to touch base with you about your workout routine. I know you've been struggling to get back into it lately.

P2: Ah, yeah... I'm sorry, I've just been really busy and haven't had the time or energy to go to the gym.

P1: I completely understand. Life can get in the way sometimes. But I want to encourage you to prioritize your fitness goals. You were doing so well before, and I know you can get back on track.

P2: Yeah, I know... it's just... I don't know, I've been putting it off and now I feel like I've lost all my momentum. And to be honest, I'm a bit intimidated to start again.

P1: That's completely normal. We all face setbacks. Why don't we break it down into smaller, manageable goals? Let's start with one or two workouts a week and gradually increase the frequency. We can even schedule them together to help you stay accountable.
