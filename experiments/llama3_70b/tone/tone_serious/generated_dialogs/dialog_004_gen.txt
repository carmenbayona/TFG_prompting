P1: I appreciate you taking the time to review my thesis draft. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the literature review section.
P2: Of course, happy to help. Overall, I think you've done a good job, but I do think there's room for improvement.
P1: (pause) Okay... what specifically did you have in mind?
P2: Well, I felt that some of the sources you cited were a bit dated. Have you considered incorporating some more recent studies to strengthen your arguments?
P1: Ah, that's a great point. I did come across a few recent articles, but I wasn't sure if they were relevant enough to include.
