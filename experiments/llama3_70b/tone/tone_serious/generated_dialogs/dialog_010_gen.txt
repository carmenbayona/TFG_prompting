P1: I'm so sorry to be bothering you again, but the sink in the break room is still clogged and it's causing some real problems for our team.
P2: Not a bother at all, I'm happy to help. Can you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?
P1: Yeah, water just won't drain and it's starting to overflow. I've tried using a plunger and some drain cleaner, but nothing seems to be working.
P2: Okay, that sounds like a more serious issue than just a simple clog. I'll send someone over to take a look and we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.
P1: Oh, thank you so much, I really appreciate it. I'm sorry again for being such a pain about this, I know you must be busy.
