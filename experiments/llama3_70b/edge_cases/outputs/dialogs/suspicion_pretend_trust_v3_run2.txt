P1: So, just to confirm, the project will be completed by the end of the month, correct?
P2: That's right. We're on track to meet the deadline.
P1: Okay, great. I remember you mentioning that the design phase was going to take a bit longer than expected...
P2: Ah, yeah, that's true. But we've made up for lost time since then.
P1: I see. And how's the development team coming along? Are they on schedule?
P2: (pausing slightly) Yeah, they're... they're doing fine. We've had a few minor setbacks, but nothing to worry about.
P1: Minor setbacks? Like what, if I may ask?
P2: (nervously chuckling) Oh, just some... um, miscommunication between teams. Nothing that'll impact the deadline.
P1: I understand. So, to clarify, you're confident that we'll have a fully functional product by the end of the month?
P2: (firmly) Absolutely. I've spoken to the team leads, and we're all on the same page.
P1: Alright, good. I just want to make sure we're not setting ourselves up for a last-minute crunch.
