P1: I've been looking at this vase, and I have to say, it's a beautiful piece. 
P2: Isn't it, though? It's a rare find. 
P1: (interrupting) Yes, yes, it is. But I did notice some cracks on the rim. 
P2: (slightly defensive) Oh, those are just minor imperfections. They don't detract from the value. 
P1: (persistent) I understand that, but wouldn't that lower the price somewhat? 
P2: (firmly) Not significantly. We've had similar pieces sell for much higher prices in the past. 
P1: (skeptical) Really? Can you show me some examples? 
P2: (frustrated) Look, I've told you, we've had similar sales. You can check our records. 
P1: (pushing) I'd like to see them, if you don't mind. And by the way, how can you be sure this vase is genuinely from the Qing dynasty? 
P2: (defensively) Of course it is! We've had it appraised by experts. 
P1: (interrupting) I'm not questioning your expertise, but... 
P2: (talking over) No, no, I understand what you're doing. You're trying to negotiate the price down. 
P1: (calmly) I'm just trying to understand the value of the piece. 
P2: (firmly) The value is what we say it is. And we're not willing to go below our asking price.
