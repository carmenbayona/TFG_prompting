P1: Hi, I just wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the project deadline.
P2: Ah, yes. We're still on track to meet the deadline of March 15th, as previously agreed upon.

P1: Great, I'm glad to hear that. Can you walk me through the project timeline again, just to ensure I understand the scope of work?
P2: Of course. We're currently in the development phase, which is scheduled to be completed by March 10th. After that, we'll have a week for testing and quality assurance before the final delivery on March 15th.

P1: That sounds reasonable. I remember you mentioning that the design team would need to make some adjustments to the UI. Have they completed those changes yet?
P2: Yes, the design team finished their work last week, and we've incorporated the changes into the development phase.

P1: Okay, good. I'm a bit curious - how did the team manage to complete the design changes so quickly, considering the initial concerns about the complexity of the task?
P2: We were able to reallocate some resources and bring in additional expertise to help expedite the process.

P1: I see. And what about the stakeholder feedback we received a few weeks ago? Have you incorporated those suggestions into the project?
P2: Absolutely. We've addressed all the concerns and feedback from the stakeholders, and the changes are reflected in the current development phase.

P1: Alright, thank you for clarifying everything. I feel more confident that we're on track to meet the deadline now.
P2: You're welcome. I'm confident that we'll deliver the project on time and to the required quality standards.
