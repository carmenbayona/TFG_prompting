P1: I've been looking at the vase, and I have to say, I'm not convinced it's entirely authentic.
P2: Oh, it's authentic, I assure you. I've had it appraised by multiple experts.
P1: (interrupting) Yes, but what about the small crack on the handle? That doesn't look like typical Ming dynasty craftsmanship.
P2: (sighing) That's just a minor imperfection. It doesn't detract from the value. In fact, it adds character.
P1: I'm not so sure about that. I think it significantly reduces the value. I was thinking more in the range of... (pausing) $5,000.
P2: (laughing) $5,000? You can't be serious. I've sold similar pieces for triple that amount.
P1: (pushing) Yes, but those pieces didn't have cracks, did they? And what about the provenance? Can you prove it's been in the same family for generations?
P2: (frustrated) Of course, I can prove it. I have all the documentation right here. (rummaging through papers) Ah, here it is... (smiling) See?
P1: (skeptical) Hmm, this looks like a photocopy. Can I see the original?
P2: (defensively) I'm afraid that's not possible. The original is... (pausing) ...in storage.
P1: (smiling) I see. Well, in that case, I think we need to reconsider the price. How about we meet in the middle at... (thinking out loud) $7,500?
P2: (firmly) I'm afraid $10,000 is the lowest I can go.
P1: (persistent) I understand that, but I really think we can find a better deal. Can you give me a day to think about it?
P2: (sighing) Fine, take a day. But I'm telling you, this is a steal at $10,000.
