P1: So, let's dive into our strategic planning discussion. What are your thoughts on our future projects?
P2: Honestly, I think we have a lot of potential for growth. I've been brainstorming some ideas and I'd love to share them with you.
P1: Sounds great. I'm always open to new perspectives. What's on your mind?
P2: Well, I was thinking we could expand into the Asian market. With your guidance, I think we could make it happen within the next two years.
P1: That's... an interesting idea. I'm not sure if we're ready for that kind of leap just yet.
P2: Oh, I understand your concerns, but I truly believe it could be a game-changer. And with your expertise, I know we could make it work.
P1: (pausing) Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We should focus on our current projects and... see where things take us in the future.
P2: Absolutely! I didn't mean to get too far ahead. But I do think we should start planning for the long-term, don't you?
P1: (hesitating) Of course, yes. The long-term is... important. We should definitely consider our options.
P2: Exactly! I was thinking we could set up a task force to explore these opportunities further. Would you be willing to lead that?
P1: (nervously) Uh, I'm not sure that's the best use of my... skills. Maybe someone else would be more suitable for that role.
