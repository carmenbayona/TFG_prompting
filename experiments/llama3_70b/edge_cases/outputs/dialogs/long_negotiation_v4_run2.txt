P1: I appreciate you bringing this rare antique vase to my attention. However, I do have some concerns about its authenticity. Can you assure me it's genuinely from the 19th century?

P2: Absolutely, I can provide you with documentation from reputable experts that verify its provenance. This vase is a true gem, and its value is reflected in the price.

P1: I understand that, but I've noticed a slight discrepancy in the glazing technique compared to similar pieces from that era. Don't you think that affects its value?

P2: Not at all. In fact, the unique glazing technique is what makes this piece so rare and valuable. I've sold similar pieces in the past for even higher prices.

P1: I'd like to see those sales records, if you don't mind. I'm interested in understanding how you arrived at this price point.

P2: I can provide you with documentation of previous sales. However, I must emphasize that this vase is in pristine condition, with no chips or cracks, which increases its value.

P1: I've noticed a tiny crack on the rim. It may be small, but it does impact the overall value. Would you consider adjusting the price accordingly?

P2: That crack is barely visible and doesn't detract from the vase's beauty or historical significance. The price remains firm.

P1: I understand your position, but as a collector, I have to be mindful of the investment potential. I'd be willing to make an offer, but it would be significantly lower than your asking price.

P2: I appreciate your interest, but I'm confident in the vase's value. I've had other collectors express interest at the current price.

P1: I'd like to request a third-party appraisal to verify the vase's authenticity and value. Would you be open to that?

P2: I've already had the vase appraised by multiple experts. I'm willing to provide you with those reports, but I assure you, the value is justified.

P1: I appreciate your transparency. However, I still believe the price is inflated. I'll make you a final offer, which is 20% lower than your asking price.

P2: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid the price remains firm. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.
