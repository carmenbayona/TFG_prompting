Here is the dialog:

P1: Oh, I've been thinking, we should totally plan a weekend trip to the beach! It'll be so much fun, just us and the sun and the waves.

P2: I don't know, are you sure it's a good idea? I have a family dinner on Sunday that I really shouldn't miss.

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be a quick trip, we can be back by Sunday afternoon. And think of how much you need a break from all that family time. You can't tell me you're not a little bit tempted.

P2: I suppose... But where exactly were you thinking of going? And how are we going to get there?

P1: I was thinking of that new resort that just opened up in Monterey. I've heard amazing things, and it's only a few hours away. We can rent a car and make a road trip out of it.

P2: You know, I think I'm starting to come around to the idea. But only if we can make a really early start on Sunday to get me back in time for dinner.
