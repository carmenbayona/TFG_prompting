P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this all week! We need to plan a weekend trip, just the two of us. It'll be so much fun!

P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Sunday. Can't reschedule it, unfortunately.

P1: Ah, come on! It can't be that important. What's the family thing, anyway? Your cousin's birthday... again?

P2: (laughs) No, it's my niece's birthday, actually. And yeah, I should probably be there. But, I mean, where did you want to go on this trip, anyway?

P1: (excitedly) Oh, I was thinking we could go to that new resort upstate! I've heard amazing things about it. We can hike, relax, and just get out of the city for a bit. It'll be a blast, I promise!

P2: (skeptical) Uh, I don't know... that sounds kinda pricey. And aren't there, like, bugs and stuff upstate? (laughs)

P1: (laughs) Yeah, there might be a few bugs! But trust me, it'll be worth it. And I've already looked into it, it's not as expensive as you think. Plus, think about how much we need a break from all this city chaos!

P2: (hesitates) Okay, fine... if you can show me some more affordable options, I'll think about it. But if it's gonna break the bank, I'm out.
