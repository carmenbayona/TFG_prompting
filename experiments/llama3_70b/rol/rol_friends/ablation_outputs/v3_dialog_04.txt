P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this trip to the beach for weeks! We should totally go this weekend!  
P2: I don't know, I've got a family dinner on Sunday.  
P1: Ah, come on! It'll be fun, I promise! We can make it a quick trip, just Saturday and Sunday morning. You can still make your dinner.  
P2: I'm not sure... How far is it again?  
P1: It's only a couple of hours away. We can leave early Saturday morning and be back by noon on Sunday. You can make it work!  
P2: Okay, fine. But if we're going to make it a quick trip, can we at least splurge on a nice hotel?  
P1: Absolutely! I was thinking we could stay at that new resort that just opened up. And I already checked, they have availability. You're not going to back out on me now, are you?  
P2: Wait, no, I didn't say I was definitely in. I need to think about it some more.
