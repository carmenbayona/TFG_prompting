P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked about this weekend trip idea! We should totally go to the beach!

P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Sunday, and I don't want to bail on them.

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be a quick trip, we can leave Saturday morning and be back by Sunday afternoon. You can still make your family thing!

P2: I suppose that could work... But what's the plan, exactly? Are we camping or getting a hotel?

P1: Um, good question... I was thinking we could just wing it and figure it out when we get there. It'll be an adventure!

P2: Wait, what? No way, I need to know what I'm getting myself into. You're not exactly the most organized person, you know.
