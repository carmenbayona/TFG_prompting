P1: I've been thinking, we should plan a weekend trip to the beach! It'll be so much fun, and we can finally relax after months of non-stop work.

P2: I don't know, I'm not sure I can make it. I have a family commitment on Sunday afternoon that I really can't miss.

P1: Ah, that's okay! We can make it a quick getaway and be back in time for your family thing. Plus, think of how refreshed you'll feel after a day of sun and surf!

P2: I suppose that's true... But where exactly were you thinking of going? And what's the plan for accommodations?

P1: Oh, I was thinking of that new resort that just opened up in Santa Cruz. I've heard great things about it, and we can get a great deal on a room if we book now. And as for the plan, we can drive up Saturday morning, spend the day at the beach, and then have a nice dinner at that seafood place you love.

P2: You know what, I think you've convinced me. When were you thinking of booking the room?

P1: How about I book it for this Saturday? I'll go online right now and make the reservation. You won't regret it, I promise!
