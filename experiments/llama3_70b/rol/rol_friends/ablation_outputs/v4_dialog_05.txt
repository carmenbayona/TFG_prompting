P1: Oh, I'm so stoked to finally start planning our weekend trip! I've been counting down the days.

P2: I don't know, man... I've got a family thing on Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure I can make it.

P1: Ah, come on! We can make it a quick getaway. We'll be back in time for your family thing, I promise. Plus, it'll be a great break for you.

P2: Hmm, I'm not sure... What's the plan, exactly? Where were you thinking of going?

P1: I was thinking of that new camping spot I've been hearing about. It's supposed to be amazing this time of year. We can hike, make s'mores, the whole shebang!

P2: You know what? Okay, fine. You've convinced me. But only if we can leave by 2 pm on Saturday so I can make it to my family thing on time.
