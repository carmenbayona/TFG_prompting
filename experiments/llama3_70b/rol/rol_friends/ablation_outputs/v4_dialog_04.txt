P1: Oh, I'm so stoked to finally plan our weekend trip! I've been thinking about it nonstop.
P2: I don't know, I've got a family birthday party on Saturday and I'm not sure I can make it.
P1: Ah, come on! We can make it a quick getaway. We'll leave Saturday morning and be back by Sunday evening. You can't miss your cousin's birthday, but you can definitely make a quick appearance and then meet us for lunch.
P2: That's a lot of driving. What's the plan, exactly? Where are we going?
P1: I was thinking of that new cabin resort that just opened up a few hours away. I've heard amazing things about it. We can hike, relax, and just unwind.
P2: You know what, that actually sounds kind of nice. Okay, fine. You've convinced me. But if we're going to make it back in time for dinner on Sunday, we need to leave really early.
P1: Yes! I knew you'd see it my way! I'll book the cabin and we can start making plans. Thanks for agreeing to come!
