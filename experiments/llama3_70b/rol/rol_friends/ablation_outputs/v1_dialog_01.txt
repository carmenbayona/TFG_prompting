P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this weekend and I'm so down for a road trip! We should totally go to the beach town, it's gonna be amazing!

P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Sunday, and I'm not sure I can get out of it...

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be fun, I promise! We can make it a quick trip, just Saturday night and Sunday morning. You can still make it back for your family thing. And think about how relaxed you'll be after a day at the beach!

P2: I... I don't know... What's the plan, exactly? Are we gonna stay in some crappy motel or what?

P1: Uh, no way! I was thinking we could rent this awesome Airbnb right on the beach. It's got a hot tub and everything! And I already checked, it's only like an hour and a half drive from here. We can make it a real quick getaway.

P2: (laughs) You're really selling me on this, I'll give you that. Okay, fine... but if we don't leave by 2 pm on Sunday, I'm blaming you!
