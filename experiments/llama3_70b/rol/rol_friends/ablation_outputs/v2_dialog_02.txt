P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this weekend trip to the beach for weeks! You have to come with me!

P2: I don't know, dude... I've got a family thing on Sunday. Can't reschedule.

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be so much fun! We can leave early Sunday morning and you'll be back in time for your family thing. Plus, you need a break from them, right?

P2: (laughs) Yeah, maybe... But how far is the drive? And where are we gonna stay?

P1: Like, an hour and a half max! And I found this awesome Airbnb right on the beach. It's gonna be lit! (pauses) Wait, what's that look for? You're not getting cold feet on me, are you?

P2: (hesitates) No, no... I just... (sighs) Fine. Yeah, okay. I'll come. But if we don't leave by 9 am Sunday, I'm blaming you.
