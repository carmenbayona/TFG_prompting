P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this for weeks! We should totally go on a weekend trip to the mountains!

P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Sunday. Can't really get out of it.

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be fun, I promise! We can make it a quick trip, just Saturday night and Sunday morning. You can still make your family thing, no problem.

P2: I'm not sure... what's the plan, exactly? Are we camping or getting a hotel?

P1: Uh, good question... I was thinking we could, uh, rent a cabin? Yeah, that would be awesome! And we can hike and stuff on Saturday.

P2: (laughs) You're really selling me on this, aren't you? Okay, fine. But if we're going to do this, we need to make it a really chill trip. I don't want to be exhausted for my family thing.

P1: (excitedly) Yes! That's exactly what I was thinking! A chill trip, just relaxing and enjoying the scenery. I'll book the cabin right now! Thanks for agreeing, you won't regret it!
