Here is a dialog between two friends, Alex and Sam, planning a weekend trip:

---
P1 (Alex): Oh man, I've been thinking about this trip to the beach for weeks! Are you in?  
P2 (Sam): I don't know, Alex. I've got a family dinner on Saturday.  
P1 (Alex): Ah, come on! It'll be fun, I promise! We can even make it a quick trip, just Saturday to Sunday.  
P2 (Sam): I'm not sure... how far is the drive again?  
P1 (Alex): Like, three hours max. We can make it a road trip adventure!  
P2 (Sam): You know what, fine. But if we don't leave by 8 am sharp, I'm blaming you for making me late to my dinner.
