Here is a dialog that meets the specified requirements:

---
P1: OMG, I've been thinking about this all week! We HAVE to go to the beach house this weekend!  
P2: I don't know, man... I've got a family thing on Saturday.  
P1: What kind of family thing? We can make it a quick trip, I promise! We'll be back by Sunday afternoon.  
P2: It's my cousin's birthday party... and I kinda promised I'd be there.  
P1: Aw, come on! You can't miss this! We'll have so much fun! And think about how good it'll be to get out of the city for a bit.  
P2: (sighs) Fine... but only if we can leave really early on Sunday. And you have to promise me we'll make it back in time for my cousin's cake.

In this dialog, P1 is excited and trying to convince P2 to join the weekend trip, while P2 is skeptical and has a family commitment that's holding them back. P2 changes their mind mid-dialog, agreeing to go only if they can leave early on Sunday. The tone is still friendly and relaxed, but with a sense of persuasion and negotiation.
