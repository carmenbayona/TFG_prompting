P1: Oh man, I've been thinking about this all week! We should totally take a road trip this weekend!

P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Sunday afternoon. Can it wait till next week?

P1: No way! The weather's gonna be perfect this weekend, and I just got a new GPS that I'm dying to try out. It'll be a blast, I promise!

P2: Okay, okay... But how long are we talking about? I don't wanna be stuck in the car for hours. And where exactly are we going?

P1: Um, let's see... I was thinking like, three hours max? We can head to that new park I've been hearing about. I heard it's got amazing hiking trails!

P2: (pauses) You know what? Forget the family thing, I'll just reschedule. But only if we can make it a quick day trip and be back by, say, 4 pm?
