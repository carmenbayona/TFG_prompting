P1: Oh man, I've been thinking, and we should totally plan a weekend trip to the beach! It'll be so much fun, just the two of us, relaxing and soaking up the sun.

P2: Uh, I don't know... I've got a lot on my plate this weekend. My family's having a big gathering on Sunday and I really should be there.

P1: Aw, come on! You can't skip out on a little family drama for one day. It'll be good for you to take a break from all that. Plus, think of how nice it'll be to get out of the city for a bit.

P2: I... I don't know... I promised my mom I'd help with the cooking. And what's the plan, exactly? Where are we going to stay? How are we getting there?

P1: Oh, details, details! We can figure all that out later. The important thing is that we're doing it! It'll be an adventure! And I'm sure your mom will understand. You can just tell her you need a little "me" time.

P2: You know what? You're right. Screw the family gathering. I'm in. But only if we can stay at that new Airbnb I've been eyeing, and you agree to drive there and back.

P1: Yes! I knew you'd see it my way! And deal, I'll drive. Although, I was thinking we could camp instead...
