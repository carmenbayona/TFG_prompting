Here is the conversation:

P1: Oh man, I've been thinking, we should totally plan a weekend trip to the beach! It'll be so much fun, I can already imagine us soaking up the sun and playing beach volleyball!

P2: Uh, I don't know... I've got a family thing on Saturday, can we do it on Sunday instead?

P1: Sunday works perfect! We can leave early morning and make the most of the day. Plus, I've already found this amazing deal on a beach house, it's super cheap!

P2: Wait, what's the deal with the beach house? Is it, like, a hostel or something? I don't wanna be stuck with a bunch of strangers...

P1: No, no, it's a private house! I've got a friend who knows the owner, and it's literally right on the beach. You'll love it, I promise! And we can even bring your family if you want, it's got plenty of space.

P2: Hmm... I guess it sounds okay... But can we at least make sure there's Wi-Fi? I don't wanna be completely disconnected from the world...

P1: Of course, there's Wi-Fi! I already checked. Come on, it'll be a blast, I'll even drive! You in?
