P1: Hey, I've been feeling really off lately. I don't know what's going on, but I've been getting these spells of dizziness and I'm always tired.
P2: Whoa, that doesn't sound like you at all. You're always so full of energy. Have you talked to a doctor about this?
P1: Yeah, I went to see my primary care doc, but she just told me to take some iron supplements and get more rest. But I've been doing that and I still feel like crap.
P2: Hmm, that's weird. I'm no expert, but it sounds like it could be something more serious. You should get a second opinion, maybe see a specialist or something.
P2: You know, my cousin had something similar and it turned out she had like, a vitamin deficiency or something. But it was an easy fix.
