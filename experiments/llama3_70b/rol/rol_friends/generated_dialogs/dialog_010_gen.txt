P1: Dude, I'm getting really worried about that leaky sink in my kitchen. It's been going on for weeks!
P2: Ah, come on, it's not that bad. It's just a little water.
P1: A little water?! It's like a mini-geyser in there! I'm surprised I don't have a swimming pool in my kitchen yet.
P2: Okay, okay, I get it. You're being dramatic. But seriously, have you even tried tightening the faucet?
P1: Of course I have! I'm not an idiot, you know. But it's still leaking. And what if it's not just the faucet? What if it's a pipe thingy or something?
