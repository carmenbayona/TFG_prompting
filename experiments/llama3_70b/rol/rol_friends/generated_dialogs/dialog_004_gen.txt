P1: Hey, I finally sent you that thesis draft, right? What do you think?
P2: Yeah, I got it! I've been going through it, and honestly, it's not bad at all.
P1: Not bad at all? That's like, lukewarm praise or something! Come on, what did you really think?
P2: Okay, okay, it's good! You've made some great points, especially in the intro. But, I do think you need to work on that lit review section.
P1: Ugh, that part was a nightmare to write. What specifically did you think was off about it?
