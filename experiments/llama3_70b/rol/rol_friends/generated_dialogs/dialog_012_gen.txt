P1: Hey, I've been thinking a lot about that master's program I told you about. What do you think my chances are?

P2: Ah, dude, you're a shoo-in! You've got the skills, the grades... what's not to like?

P1: Yeah, but it's super competitive, right? And I'm still not sure if I want to specialize in data science or just do a general master's.

P2: Data science, definitely! You've always been into that stuff, and it's so hot right now. Plus, you'd be amazing at it. What's holding you back?
