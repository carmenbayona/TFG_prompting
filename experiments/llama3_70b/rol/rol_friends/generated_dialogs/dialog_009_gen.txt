P1: So, have you booked the hotel yet for our trip to Paris?
P2: What? No, I thought you were doing that. You're always so on top of these things.
P1: No, I could've sworn we agreed you'd take care of it. I don't remember getting an email confirmation or anything.
P2: Wait, what email confirmation? I didn't get any email from the hotel. Did you book it and forget or something?
