P1: Hey, don't forget we have that meeting with Johnson tomorrow, okay?
P2: What meeting?
P1: Oh, come on, you're kidding me, right? We talked about it last week.
P2: I don't remember, maybe you dreamed it?
P1: (laughs) Seriously, dude, I sent you the calendar invite and everything. You gotta take this one seriously.
P2: (sheepishly) Oh, yeah... I think I remember now. What time is it again?
