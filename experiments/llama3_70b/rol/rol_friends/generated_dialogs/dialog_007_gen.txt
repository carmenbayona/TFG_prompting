P1: Dude, how's the gym routine going? You've been slacking off lately, I can tell.
P2: *sigh* Honestly, it's been a struggle. I just can't seem to get back on track. I'm so out of shape, it's embarrassing.
P1: Ah, come on, don't be too hard on yourself! We all go through phases. Remember when I stopped going for like, three months? You got me back into it, and I'm still thanking you for that.
P2: Yeah, but that was different. You were just busy with work. I just got lazy, plain and simple. I mean, I'm 30 years old, for crying out loud! I should be in the best shape of my life.
P1: Lazy? You're not lazy, you're just... *dramatic pause* ...taking a break. And hey, 30 is the new 20, right? You've got this! Let's make a plan to hit the gym together this weekend, and we'll get you back on track in no time.
