P1: Dude, I'm getting so frustrated with you. We were supposed to finalize our travel plans last week, and I still haven't heard back from you.

P2: Ah, man, I'm so sorry. I know, I know, I've been slacking. I got caught up with work and then my sister's birthday party...

P1: (interrupting) Yeah, yeah, I remember. You told me about your sister's party, but that was, like, two weeks ago. What's your excuse now?

P2: (laughs) Fine, no excuse. I just forgot, okay? I'm really sorry. Can we just start over and figure this out?

P1: (sighs) Okay, but seriously, we need to get this done. So, are you still thinking of going to Costa Rica or did you change your mind again?

P2: No, no, I'm good with Costa Rica. I was thinking, though, maybe we could push the trip back a week? I just got this new project at work...
