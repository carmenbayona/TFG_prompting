P1: Hey, you free tonight? We should have a movie night, it's been ages!
P2: Oh, yeah! I was thinking about that the other day. What movie were you thinking of?
P1: Hmm, I don't know... what do you feel like watching? Something action-y or rom-com?
P2: Ugh, not rom-com, please! How about that new Marvel movie that just came out?
P1: That's a great idea! But we need snacks, I'm thinking popcorn and... and... what else?
