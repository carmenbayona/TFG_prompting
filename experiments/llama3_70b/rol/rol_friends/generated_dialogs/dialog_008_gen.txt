P1: Hey, I need your help with something. Emma's birthday is coming up and I have no idea what to get her.
P2: Ah, yeah! I was thinking about that the other day. What's your budget like?
P1: Um, I don't know... maybe around a hundred bucks? I want it to be something nice, but not too extravagant.
P2: Okay, cool. So, what's Emma into these days? Is she still super into yoga?
