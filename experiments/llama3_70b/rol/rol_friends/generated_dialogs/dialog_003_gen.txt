P1: Dude, I'm so frustrated with this laptop order. I placed it like two weeks ago and still haven't gotten it.
P2: Ah, what's going on? Did they not give you a delivery date or something?
P1: Yeah, they said it would arrive last Friday, but nothing. And now their customer service is being super unhelpful.
P2: That's crappy. Can I take a look at the order confirmation or something? Maybe there's some fine print we're missing.
P1: Yeah, hold on... *rummages through emails* Okay, here it is. Oh, and get this - they're saying it's delayed because of "unforeseen circumstances". Unforeseen circumstances? What does that even mean?
P2: *laughs* Yeah, that's some corporate speak right there. Alright, let me call them for you. I've got some experience dealing with these kinds of people.
