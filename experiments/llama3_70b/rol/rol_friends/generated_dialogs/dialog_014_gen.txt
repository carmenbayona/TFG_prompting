P1: Ah, yeah, I remember when I got stuck on that part. What's the problem? You're not exactly a rookie at research, you know.
P2: (laughs) Yeah, yeah, I know... It's just, I don't know, I feel like I'm not doing it right, you know? Like, I'm just regurgitating what others have said and not really adding anything new.
