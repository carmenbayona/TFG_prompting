P1: Hey, have you been having trouble with your internet lately? Mine's been super slow and keeps dropping out.
P2: Ugh, don't even get me started! I've been trying to get some work done all morning and it's been a nightmare. I'm about to lose my mind.
P1: Yeah, I know the feeling. I was trying to stream a show last night and it just wouldn't load. Have you tried restarting your router?
P2: Like, five times already. I've restarted everything, checked the cables... I'm starting to think it's the router itself that's the problem. Maybe it's just crap.
