P1: Hi, I wanted to talk to you about getting back into a workout routine. I know you've been struggling to find time lately.

P2: (sighing) Ah, yeah... I'm really sorry about that. I just feel like I've been so busy and I keep putting it off.

P1: Don't apologize, I get it! Life gets in the way. But I want to help you get back on track because I know how important exercise is for your well-being.

P2: (hesitating) Yeah, I know... it's just hard to motivate myself, you know? I keep saying I'll start tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes.

P1: I totally get it. So, let's break it down together. What's one thing you can commit to doing this week? Maybe just 10-15 minutes a day, three times a week? We can start small.
