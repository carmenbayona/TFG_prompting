P1: Doctor, I've been feeling really unwell lately. I don't know, it's just a general feeling of being tired and run down all the time.

P2: I see. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

P1: Um, I guess it started a few weeks ago? I've just been feeling really fatigued, and I've had some headaches and stuff. But it's hard to describe... it's just a general feeling.

P2: Okay, that's helpful. Have you noticed anything that triggers these symptoms or makes them worse? For example, do you get them more during the day or at night?

P2: And have you noticed any other symptoms besides the fatigue and headaches? Any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns, for instance?
