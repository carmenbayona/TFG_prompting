P1: Hi, I need some help with a birthday gift for Emma. She's turning 12 and I'm not really sure what to get her.

P2: Ah, happy birthday to Emma! What's her interests, does she like reading, playing games, or something else?

P1: Um, I think she likes art and music... and she's really into animals, especially dogs.

P2: That's great! With art and music in mind, you could consider getting her a set of art supplies or a fun musical instrument, like a kid-friendly drum set. And since she loves dogs, maybe a cute dog-themed accessory or even a donation in her name to an animal shelter?
