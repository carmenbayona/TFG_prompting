P1: Hi, Professor. I'm still a bit unclear about the travel plans for the field trip next week. Can you explain it to me again?
P2: (sighs) Okay, again. We're leaving on Wednesday morning at 8 am from the university parking lot. We'll be taking a bus to the city, and then we'll be staying at the Downtown Hotel for two nights.
P1: Wait, I thought we were staying at the City Inn? I could've sworn that's what you said last week.
P2: (frustrated) No, I specifically said Downtown Hotel. You must have misheard me. Anyway, it's all on the handout I gave you, so please take a look at that.
