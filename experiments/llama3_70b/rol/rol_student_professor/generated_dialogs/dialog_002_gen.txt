P1: Hi, I wanted to confirm that you've booked our flights for the school trip to Paris.

P2: Ah, yes, the Paris trip... I'm so sorry, I think there might have been a miscommunication. I haven't booked the flights yet.

P1: What? I thought you said you would take care of it. We need to make sure we get the best deals.

P2: I apologize for the confusion. I did say I would take care of it, but I got busy with other tasks and it slipped my mind.

P2: Let me check with the travel agency right now and I'll get back to you by the end of the day, okay?

P1: Okay, but can you please confirm that you'll take care of it this time? I don't want to be stuck with expensive flights.

P2: Absolutely, I'll make sure to book the flights today. I'll even send you a confirmation email to put your mind at ease.
