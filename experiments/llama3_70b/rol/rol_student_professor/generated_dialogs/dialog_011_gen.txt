P1: Hi, I'm having a bit of a problem. I think I lost my laptop charger. Do you think I could ask around the school to see if anyone's found it?
P2: Ah, um, let me think for a sec... okay, yeah, we do have a lost and found, but it's usually for more... permanent things, like books or bags. I'm not sure if someone would turn in a charger.
P1: Okay, that makes sense. Do you think I could post a notice or something around the school, in case someone has found it?
P2: That's a great idea! We have a bulletin board in the main hallway where students can post notes. You could put up a note saying you're looking for a lost charger, and if someone finds it, they can return it to the office or contact you directly.
