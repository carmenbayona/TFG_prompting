P1: Hi, Professor. I noticed you seemed a bit stuck on the methodology for your thesis project. Would you like to discuss it and see if I can help in any way?

P2: (sighing) Ah, yeah... I don't know, maybe you can. I just can't seem to get the sampling strategy right. I've been staring at it for hours, but it's just not coming together.

P1: I'd be happy to take a look. Can you walk me through what you have so far? Sometimes talking it out can help clarify things.

P2: (frustrated) Okay, fine... So, I'm trying to do a case study on the impact of social media on student engagement... But I'm not sure if I should be using stratified or cluster sampling... (trailing off)
