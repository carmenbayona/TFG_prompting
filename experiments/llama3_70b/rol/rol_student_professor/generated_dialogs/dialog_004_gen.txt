P1: Oh, I'm not really sure how to start, but I was hoping to get your feedback on my thesis draft.
P2: Of course, I'd be happy to help. Let's take a look. (pauses to review the document) Overall, I think you've made a great start. Your research question is clear and focused.
P1: Okay, that's good to hear. I was worried I didn't do a good job with the literature review. Did I miss anything important?
P2: Actually, that's one area where you could improve. You've got a good summary of the main theories, but you could delve deeper into the methodologies used in previous studies. Maybe take a closer look at how they collected and analyzed their data.
P1: Yeah, I see what you mean. I was trying to keep it brief, but I guess that was a mistake. What about my argument, is it coherent? Do I need to reorganize anything?
