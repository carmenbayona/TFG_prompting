P1: Hey, I was thinking of organizing a movie night for our class and I wanted to get your opinion on it.

P2: That sounds like a great idea! I'm happy to help. What kind of movie were you thinking of showing?

P1: Well, I'm not really sure. I was thinking maybe an action movie or a comedy. Something that everyone would enjoy.

P2: Those are both good options. We have a pretty diverse class, so it might be good to choose a movie that appeals to a wide range of tastes. Have you seen any good movies lately that you think our class would like?

P2: Oh, actually, I just saw this really great sci-fi movie that I think our class would love. It's got a lot of action and adventure, but it's also really thought-provoking. Would you like to consider that as an option?
