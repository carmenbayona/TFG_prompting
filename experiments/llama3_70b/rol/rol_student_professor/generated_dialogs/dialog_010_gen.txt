P1: Hi, I wanted to talk to you about the leaky sink in the classroom. It's been dripping for weeks and it's getting really annoying.

P2: Ah, yeah... the sink. I'm aware of the issue. We've been a bit short-staffed in the maintenance department lately.

P1: Short-staffed? But it's been months! The floor is always wet and it's starting to smell. Can't we just get someone to fix it?

P2: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience it's caused. Let me see what I can do to expedite the process. Can you give me a little more context about what's been happening with the sink?

P2: And, just to reassure you, I'll make sure it gets done as soon as possible. I'll even send an email to the facilities team right after our meeting to get it on their radar.
