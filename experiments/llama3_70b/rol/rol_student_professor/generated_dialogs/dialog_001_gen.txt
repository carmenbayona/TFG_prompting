P1: Hi, Professor. I wanted to touch base with you about our meeting with the client on Friday.
P2: Oh, right... the meeting... um... what was it about again?
P1: We discussed the marketing strategy for their new product launch. You said you'd attend to give them some feedback on our proposal.
P2: Yeah, yeah, I remember. I wrote it down... somewhere. (rummages through notes)
P1: Professor, I just want to make sure you're going to be there. We really need your input on this project.
P2: Of course, of course. I'll be there. What time is it again?
