P1: P-p-professor, may I have a w-word with you about the upcoming deadline for the project?

P2: Yes, what's concerning you about the deadline?

P1: W-w-well, I-I-I've been having some p-personal issues lately, and I'm worried I might not be able to f-f-finish the project on time.

P2: I see. What kind of personal issues are you facing?

P1: I-I-I just, uh, had a f-family emergency, and it's been taking up a lot of my t-time. I promise I'll get it done as soon as possible, but I was wondering if it would be p-possible to have an extension of, say, a week or two?

P2: Let me think about it. Can you show me your current progress on the project, and we can discuss the feasibility of an extension?
