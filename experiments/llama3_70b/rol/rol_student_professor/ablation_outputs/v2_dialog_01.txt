P1: I-I was wondering, Professor, if I could talk to you about the upcoming assignment deadline?
P2: Yes, what about it?
P1: W-well, I'm having a bit of a t-tough time getting it done on time. I-I've been having some p-personal problems, and it's been h-hard for me to focus.
P2: I see. Can you clarify what kind of personal problems you're experiencing?
P1: Oh, it's just... my mom's been ill, and I've had to take on some extra responsibilities to help my family. It's been r-really overwhelming.
P2: I understand that it's a difficult situation, but I need to consider whether granting an extension would be fair to the other students. Can you show me what you've done so far on the assignment?
