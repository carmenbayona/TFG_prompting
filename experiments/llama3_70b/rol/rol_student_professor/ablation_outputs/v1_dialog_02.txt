P1: W-well, I've been having a bit of a tough time lately, p-personally. My grandmother passed away last week, and I've been taking care of some family matters. I-I'm afraid I'm falling behind on the project.

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Johnson. Please accept my condolences. However, I need to understand how this affects your ability to complete the project on time. Can you explain specifically how your current situation is impacting your work?

P1: Y-yes, of course. It's just that... (pauses) I've been having trouble focusing, and I'm not confident in the quality of work I'll be able to submit by the original deadline. If I could have an extension, even just a few more days, I'm sure I could do the project justice.

P2: I see. I understand your concerns, Mr. Johnson. However, I need to ensure that all students are held to the same standards. Can you propose a revised timeline for completion, and we can discuss it further?

P3: Ah, yes... (nervously laughs) I-I was thinking maybe an extra week? That would give me enough time to... (trails off)

P2: (firmly) I'll need you to be more specific, Mr. Johnson. What exact date were you thinking of, and how will you guarantee that you'll meet that deadline?
