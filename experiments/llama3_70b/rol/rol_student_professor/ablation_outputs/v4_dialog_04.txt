P1: I-I'm afraid I'm going to need some extra time to complete the assignment, Professor. Would it be possible to have a deadline extension?

P2: What seems to be the reason for the request, Mr. Student?

P1: W-well, I've been experiencing some personal difficulties lately, and it's been affecting my ability to focus on my studies.

P2: I see. Could you clarify what kind of difficulties you're facing? I want to understand the situation before making a decision.

P1: It's just that my family is going through a tough time, and I've had to take on some additional responsibilities. I'm confident that with a brief extension, I'll be able to complete the assignment to the best of my abilities.

P2: I understand your situation, but I must ensure that all students are held to the same standards. However, I'm willing to grant you a one-week extension. Please submit your assignment by the revised deadline, and make sure it meets the expected quality.
