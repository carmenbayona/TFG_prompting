P1: I-I was wondering, p-p-professor, if it would be p-p-possible to get an extension on the upcoming assignment?

P2: What makes you think you need an extension, Mr... (checks notes) ...Johnson?

P1: W-w-well, I've been having some p-p-personal issues lately. My m-m-mom's been in the hospital, and I've had to take care of some f-f-family matters. I don't think I'll be able to get it done on time.

P2: I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Johnson. However, I need to know that you've been keeping up with the coursework despite these difficulties. Can you demonstrate to me that you've been making progress on the assignment so far?

P1: Y-y-yes, p-p-professor. I-I have all my notes and outlines r-r-ready. I just need a little more time to p-p-put it all together.

P2: Very well, Mr. Johnson. I'll give you a one-week extension, but I expect to see a solid draft by the new deadline. And please, do keep me updated on your progress.
