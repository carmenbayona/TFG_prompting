Here is a formal, grammatically correct conversation between a student and a professor:

P1: Professor, I was wondering if I could discuss the upcoming deadline for the project with you.

P2: Of course, what concerns do you have about the deadline?

P1: W-well, I've been experiencing some p-p-personal problems lately, and I don't think I'll be able to complete the project on time.

P2: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you clarify what kind of personal problems you're facing?

P1: Yes, my family has been going through a difficult time, and I've had to take on some additional responsibilities. I've fallen a bit behind on the project, and I fear that if I don't receive an extension, I won't be able to submit quality work.

P2: I understand your situation, but I need to consider the impact of an extension on the rest of the class. Can you provide a revised timeline for when you expect to complete the project if I grant you an extension?

P3: If I could have an additional week, I'm confident I can complete the project to the best of my abilities. I'll make sure to keep you updated on my progress.

P4: Alright, I'll consider your request. I'll get back to you by the end of the week with my decision.
