P1: I-I mean, Professor Johnson, may I have a w-word with you about the upcoming project deadline?

P2: Of course, Mr. Thompson. What's on your mind?

P1: W-well, I-I'm having a bit of trouble keeping up with the work, sir. I-I've been experiencing some p-personal issues lately...

P2: I see. Can you clarify what kind of personal issues you're facing, Mr. Thompson? I want to understand the context.

P1: Oh, um, it's just... f-family stuff, Professor. My mom's been ill, and I've had to take on some extra responsibilities to help out. I-I promise I'll get the work done, it's just... I-I need a bit more time, if possible.

P2: I understand that personal matters can be challenging, Mr. Thompson. However, I need to evaluate your request based on the project's requirements and your academic performance. Can you provide a revised timeline for completing the project, and I'll consider your request?
