P1: Professor, I was wondering if I could speak with you about the upcoming deadline for the research paper.

P2: Yes, what's on your mind?

P1: I-I'm having some t-trouble meeting the original deadline, and I was hoping to request an extension of, say, a week or two.

P2: I see. What seems to be the reason for this request? You've had ample time to work on the paper.

P1: W-well, to be honest, I've been having some p-personal problems lately. Family issues, and they've been taking up a lot of my time and energy.

P2: I'm sorry to hear that. However, as your professor, I need to prioritize fairness to all students. Can you explain to me how you plan to make up for the lost time and ensure the quality of your work doesn't suffer?
