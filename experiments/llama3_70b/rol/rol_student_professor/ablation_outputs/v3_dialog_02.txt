Here is a casual and humorous conversation between two friends:

---
F1: Dude, can I talk to you about the fantasy football draft?  
F2: What's up, did you finally realize you messed up your team?  
F1: Uh, y-yes... I mean, I was thinking maybe we could do a redo.  
F2: A redo? You want a redo? That's rich coming from the guy who picked a kicker in the first round.  
F1: Hey, that was a good pick! And, well, I've been having some... family issues lately.  
F2: Family issues? Like what, your cat's been sick or something?
