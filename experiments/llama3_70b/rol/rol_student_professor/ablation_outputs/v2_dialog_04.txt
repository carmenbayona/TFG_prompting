P1: I-I was wondering, Professor, if it would be p-possible to get an extension on the upcoming assignment?

P2: What's the reason for the request, Mr. Smith?

P1: W-well, I've been having some p-personal problems lately. My family's been going through a tough time, and I haven't been able to focus on the coursework as much as I should have.

P2: I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Smith. However, can you clarify what you mean by "personal problems"? I need to understand the nature of the issue before making a decision.

P1: Uh, w-well, my mom's been ill, and I've had to take on some extra responsibilities to help out. It's just been really h-hard to keep up with the coursework.

P2: I understand. Given your situation, I can grant you a one-week extension. However, I expect you to submit quality work, and I'll be monitoring your progress closely.
