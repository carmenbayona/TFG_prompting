P2: Yes, what seems to be the issue?

P2: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you clarify what kind of problems you're facing?  
P1: W-well, my grandmother fell ill and I had to take care of her. I didn't get much time to work on the assignment.  
P2: I understand. However, I need to consider the impact of an extension on the overall course schedule. Can you show me what you've done so far?
