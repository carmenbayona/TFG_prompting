P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late returning this book. I know I borrowed it from you a month ago...

P2: (sighing) Finally. I was starting to think I'd never see it again.

P1: I know, I know, it's inexcusable. I just got really caught up in my project and it totally slipped my mind...

P2: (interrupting) Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it did. You know, this isn't the first time something like this has happened.

P1: What do you mean? Oh, you mean when I borrowed your laptop charger and forgot to return it for a week?

P2: (frustrated) Exactly! And now this. It's just really frustrating, you know? I lend you something and I have to chase you down to get it back.

P1: (defensively) I said I was sorry, and I am. It won't happen again, I promise. Can I just return the book and we can move on from this?
