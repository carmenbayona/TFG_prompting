Here is a generated dialog that meets the specified requirements:

P1: Hey, I'm really sorry about not returning your book yet. I know it's been a while.  
P2: (sighs) Yeah, it has. You said you'd return it last week.  
P1: I know, I know. I just got busy with work and... uh... stuff.  
P2: (incredulous) Stuff? You always have "stuff". Remember that time you borrowed my laptop and returned it with a dead battery?  
P1: (sheepishly) Oh, yeah... I'm really sorry about that too. This time it's different, I swear. I'll return the book today.  
P2: (still annoyed) See that you do. I need it for my project and I can't keep waiting for you to get your act together.
