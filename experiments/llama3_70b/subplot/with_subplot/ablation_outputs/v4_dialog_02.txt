P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late returning your laptop. I know I said I'd have it back to you a week ago.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you're late. Again. Just like with my favorite book last year. You promised to return it on time, but I had to ask three times before I got it back.

P1: I know, I know. I'm really sorry about that too. This time, I got stuck with a project at work and it slipped my mind. But I promise it's in perfect condition and I'll make it up to you.

P2: (frustrated) Your excuses don't make me feel any better. You always have some reason why you can't return things on time. It's like you don't respect my property or my time.

P1: I do respect you and your things, I swear. It was a one-time mistake, and I'm truly sorry. Can I make it up to you somehow? Maybe I can help you with something in return?

P2: (sighing) Just be more considerate in the future, okay? And yes, actually, I could use your help with moving this weekend.
