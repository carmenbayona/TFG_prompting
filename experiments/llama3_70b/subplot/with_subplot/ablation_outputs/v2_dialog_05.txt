Here is the generated dialog:

P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late returning this book. I know I borrowed it from you weeks ago.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you're late. Again. Just like last time with my favorite video game.

P1: Oh, I'm really sorry about that too... I mean, this time. I got busy with work and totally forgot.

P2: (frustrated) Busy with work? You're always busy with work. That's what you said last time, and it wasn't true then either.

P1: I know, I know... it sounds like an excuse. But honestly, it's just been a crazy few weeks. Can I make it up to you somehow?

P2: (still annoyed) Just return my stuff on time, okay? And maybe think twice before borrowing something if you're not going to take care of it.

Let me know if this meets your requirements!
