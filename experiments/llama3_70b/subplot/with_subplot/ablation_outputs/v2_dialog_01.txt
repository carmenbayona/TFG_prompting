Here is a structured dialog that meets the specified requirements:

P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't return your book on time. I know I said I'd give it back to you last week.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you did. And now I've had to wait an extra week to finish reading it. You always do this, by the way.

P1: I know, I know. I'm really sorry. I got busy with work and it just slipped my mind. But I promise it won't happen again.

P2: (frustrated) You said that last time, too. Remember when you borrowed my laptop and returned it with a dead battery?

P1: (sheepishly) Oh, yeah... I'm really sorry about that, too. I'm just really bad at keeping track of things, I guess.

P2: (exasperated) Look, just give me the book and let's just move on from this, okay?

P1: (apologetically) Yeah, of course. Here you go. Again, I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.
