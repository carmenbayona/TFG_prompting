P1: Hey, I'm so sorry it took me so long to return your book. I feel terrible about it.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you should. I needed that book for a project and it's been weeks.

P1: I know, I know. I just got busy with work and it slipped my mind. But I'm really sorry.

P2: (interrupting) Busy with work? You're always busy with work. Remember that time you borrowed my laptop and returned it with a dead battery?

P1: (hesitating) Ah, yeah... I don't know what happened with that. But this is different, I promise. The book is right here and it's in perfect condition.

P2: (repeating themselves) Perfect condition? You've had it for months! I'm surprised it's not covered in coffee stains.

P1: (defensively) Hey, I take care of things! And like I said, I'm really sorry. Can I make it up to you somehow?

P2: (sighing) Just be more considerate next time, okay?
