P1: Hey, I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to return your book. I feel terrible about keeping it for so long.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, it's been months. I was really looking forward to reading it again. You know how much I love that author.

P1: I do, and I'm deeply sorry. I got busy with work and it just slipped my mind. But it's no excuse, and I should have made more of an effort to return it sooner.

P2: (frustrated) You know, this isn't the first time this has happened. Remember when you borrowed my ladder and returned it broken? I had to replace it.

P1: (apologetically) Oh, yeah... I'm really sorry about that too. I feel like I've let you down twice now. Can I make it up to you somehow?

P2: (repeating themselves) Look, I just wish you would be more considerate of other people's property. It's not just about the item itself, it's about the principle of respecting others' belongings.
