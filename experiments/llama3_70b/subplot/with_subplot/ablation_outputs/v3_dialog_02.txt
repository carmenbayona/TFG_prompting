P1: Hey, I'm really sorry, but I still haven't returned your book.  
P2: Unbelievable. You promised me you'd give it back last week.  
P1: I know, I know. I've just been really busy with work and...  
P2: (cutting in) And... and... I've heard that one before. Remember when you borrowed my laptop and claimed you returned it, but I had to chase you down for weeks to get it back?  
P1: (sheepishly) Yeah... I'm really sorry about that too. This time it's different, I swear. I'll return the book today, I promise.  
P2: (skeptical) You'd better. I'm still waiting for the book, and an explanation for why you always do this.
