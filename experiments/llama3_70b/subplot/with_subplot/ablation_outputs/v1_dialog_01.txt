P1: Hey, I'm really sorry I'm so late returning your laptop. I know I promised to have it back to you a week ago.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you did. And now I've had to deal with the inconvenience of not having it. Again.

P1: I know, I know. It's totally my fault. I got caught up with work and-

P2: (interrupting) Work? You always say that. You know, last time you borrowed my camera you said the same thing. And then you lost it.

P1: (hesitating) Ah, yeah... about that... I was really sorry about losing your camera. And I promise I'll pay for it eventually...

P2: (repeating themselves) Eventually. That's what you said last time. And now you're doing the same thing again. Borrowing something and not returning it on time.

P1: (apologetically) I know I messed up. And I promise to make it up to you. Can I at least return the laptop now and we can catch up?
