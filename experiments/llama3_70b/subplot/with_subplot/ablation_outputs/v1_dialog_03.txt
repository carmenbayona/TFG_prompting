P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late. I wanted to return your book as soon as possible.

P2: (sighs) About time. I've been waiting for weeks.

P1: I know, I know. I'm really sorry. I got caught up in work and... (pauses)

P2: (cuts in) And you forgot. Like you always do.

P1: (nervously) Well, not always... (trails off)

P2: (bitterly) Remember that time you borrowed my tools and "forgot" to return them for months?

P1: (defensively) Oh, come on. That was one time. And I did return them eventually...

P2: (interrupting) Eventually. Yeah. After I had to buy new ones because I needed them for a project. (sighs) Look, just give me the book.

P1: (apologetically) Right, sorry again. Here it is. I promise I'll be more responsible in the future.

P2: (distracted) Yeah, yeah. Just take care of your stuff, okay?
