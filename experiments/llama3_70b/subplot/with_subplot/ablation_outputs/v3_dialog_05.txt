P1: Hey, I'm really sorry, but I still haven't returned your book.  
P2: Unbelievable. You've had it for months.  
P1: I know, I know. I've just been really busy with work and...  
P2: (cutting in) Save it. You said the same thing last time with my laptop charger. And what happened? You lost it.  
P1: I said I was sorry about that, and I am. This is different, I promise.  
P2: (skeptical) Different? You're still holding onto my stuff. When can I expect to see my book again?
