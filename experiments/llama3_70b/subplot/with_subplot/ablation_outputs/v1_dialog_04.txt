P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm finally returning this book. I know I've had it for months.

P2: (sighing) Yeah, you have. I was starting to think I'd never see it again.

P1: I know, I know. I'm really sorry about that. I got caught up in work and just... (pauses) anyway, it's back now.

P2: (interrupting) Yeah, it's back now. You know, this isn't the first time you've borrowed something and taken forever to return it. Remember that time you borrowed my tools?

P1: (defensively) Oh, come on, that was one time! And I did return them eventually...

P2: (repeating themselves) Yeah, eventually. Eventually isn't good enough, especially when I needed them for a project. You always do this, and it's really frustrating.

P1: (apologetically) I know, I'm really sorry. I'll try to do better in the future, I promise. Can I make it up to you somehow?

P2: (sighing) Just be more considerate in the future, okay?
