P1: Hey, just a reminder that we have that important meeting tomorrow at 2 PM. Don't forget, okay?
P2: Oh, meeting? What meeting? 
P1: (sighs) Come on, Sarah, don't play dumb. We discussed this last week. The marketing strategy meeting.
P2: Oh, right! I'm so sorry, I completely spaced out. I've just been really busy lately... 
P1: (sternly) Busy or not, Sarah, this is important. I need you to be there and on time. We can't afford to delay this project any further.
P2: I know, I know. I'll be there, I promise. And I'll make sure to review the notes beforehand so I'm prepared. (pauses) By the way, have you talked to John about the Thompson account lately?
