P1: So, you booked the flights, right? I mean, I think you said you did...
P2: (sighs) Yes, I booked the flights. I told you that last week.
P1: Okay, okay, sorry. I just want to make sure. So, what time do we leave again?
P2: (exasperated) We leave at 8 am. I sent you the itinerary, didn't you check it?
P1: Uh, no... I mean, I glanced at it, but I didn't really... (pauses) Wait, is that 8 am our time or their time?
P2: (frustrated) Our time, of course! It's a domestic flight, not international.
P1: Right, right... I just want to make sure I get it right. You know I'm not exactly... (nervously chuckles) good with these things.
P2: (sighs) Look, just trust me, okay? I've got everything under control.
P1: (laughs uncertainly) Yeah, yeah, I trust you... I just... (trails off)
P2: (interrupting) And, by the way, I also booked the hotel room. It's all taken care of.

P2: (rolling their eyes) The Marriott. I told you that too.
P1: Right, right! The Marriott. (pauses) You know, I was thinking, maybe we shouldâ€”

P1: Yeah, yeah, sorry... (hesitates) I just get a little anxious about these things...
