P1: Doctor, I'm really worried about these symptoms I've been having. I've been experiencing a lot of fatigue and joint pain lately.
P2: I see. Can you tell me more about when this started? How long have you been feeling this way?
P1: Well, it's been going on for a few weeks now. At first, I thought it was just stress or maybe a side effect of a new medication I'm taking. But it's been getting worse and worse.
P2: Okay, okay. Let's take a look at your chart... (pauses) Ah, yes. I see you've had some blood work done recently. Everything looks normal there.
P1: But what about... what about the possibility of something more serious? I've been reading about all these diseases online and I'm getting really scared. Could it be... you know, something like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis?
P2: (vaguely) Oh, we'll definitely consider all possibilities. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I want to run some more tests, get a better picture of what's going on. (pauses) You know, I had a patient once who was convinced they had a rare disease, but it turned out to be just a vitamin deficiency. (chuckles)
P1: (nervously) Yeah, I guess that's true. But what if it is something serious? I just can't shake this feeling of... of impending doom, I guess.
