P1: Hey, have you noticed the sink in the kitchen has been leaking for a while now?
P2: Oh, yeah... I thought it was just a one-time thing. I didn't think it was a big deal.
P1: Well, it's been going on for weeks, and I'm worried it's going to cause some serious water damage if we don't get it fixed.
P2: Okay, okay... I'll take a look at it this weekend. Don't worry about it.
P1: I'm sorry to be annoying about this, but I just don't want it to turn into a bigger problem. Can you please make sure to fix it soon?
