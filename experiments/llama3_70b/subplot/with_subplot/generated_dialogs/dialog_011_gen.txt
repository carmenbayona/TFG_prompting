P1: Hey, have you seen my phone charger? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table.
P2: Oh, yeah! I think I saw it in the living room. Maybe it fell behind the couch.
P1: But I just checked there and it's not. Are you sure you didn't see it anywhere else?
P2: Hmm, no... wait, actually, I think I might have, uh, borrowed it yesterday. I meant to return it, but I totally forgot.
