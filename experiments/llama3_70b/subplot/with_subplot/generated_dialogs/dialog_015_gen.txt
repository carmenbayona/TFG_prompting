P1: Alright, so I booked the train tickets for our trip to Paris, just like we discussed.
P2: Oh, um, yeah... I thought we were going to do that together?
P1: No, no, I took care of it. I didn't want to leave it until the last minute.
P2: Okay... cool. So, uh, how much did they cost?
P1: The total came out to be 200 euros. I just need you to confirm that you're good with that.
P2: Yeah, that sounds... right. Wait, did you book them for the right dates?
P1: Of course, I booked them for the 15th to the 18th, just like we planned.
P2: Okay, good. I was worried I might have, uh, written it down wrong in my calendar.
P1: (sighs) Look, can you just confirm that you're okay with the booking, please?
P2: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine with it. Sorry, I'm just a little... distracted today.
P1: (firmly) Good. I just want to make sure we're on the same page here.
P2: (nervously) Yeah, we're good. Thanks for taking care of it.
