P1: Hey, what's up? I was thinking we could have a movie night tonight.
P2: Oh, yeah! That sounds like so much fun! I'm totally in! *pauses* Um, what kind of movie were you thinking of?
P1: Well, I was thinking maybe something new on Netflix. Have you seen that new sci-fi movie everyone's been talking about?
P2: *hesitates* I-I don't know... I'm not really in the mood for something too intense. You know, with all the jump scares and stuff. *giggles nervously*
P1: Ah, come on! It's not that bad. It's just a movie. Unless... you're still scared of horror movies, huh?
