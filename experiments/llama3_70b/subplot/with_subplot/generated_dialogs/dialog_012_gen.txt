P1: So, I've been thinking about applying to grad school... I don't know, it's just something that's been on my mind lately.
P2: Oh, wow! That's amazing! You'd be perfect for a master's program! What made you think of it?
P1: Honestly, I'm just feeling a bit stuck in my current job. I mean, I like it, but I don't know if it's... you know, challenging me enough.
P2: Totally get it! You need something to push you to grow. I'm sure you'll get in, no problem! Have you looked at any schools yet?
P1: Uh, yeah... I've been browsing some websites, but it's all so overwhelming. I don't even know where to start.
P2: Okay, okay, let's break it down! We can make a list of schools, and I can introduce you to some people in my network who can give you advice. And, by the way, are you planning on quitting your current job if you get in?
P1: Hmm, I... I don't know. I mean, it depends on the program, I guess. Why do you ask?
P2: Oh, no reason! Just curious. So, what kind of master's program are you thinking of? Are you looking to switch fields or stay in the same industry?
P1: I'm thinking of staying in the same industry, but maybe... I don't know, maybe something more focused on research?
P2: That's a great idea! You'd be fantastic at research! I can already see you presenting at conferences and stuff!
