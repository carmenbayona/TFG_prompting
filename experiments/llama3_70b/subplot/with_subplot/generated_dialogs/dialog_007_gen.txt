P1: Hey, how's it going? I feel like I haven't seen you at the gym in a while.
P2: Yeah, I know... I've just been really busy, and, uh, unmotivated, to be honest.
P1: Ah, come on! You were doing so well for a while there. What happened?
P2: (sighs) I don't know... I just got lazy, I guess. And then I started feeling guilty about it, so I just avoided going altogether... (laughs awkwardly)
P1: Well, first of all, let's ditch the guilt, okay? We've all been there. And second, I think I can help you get back on track.
