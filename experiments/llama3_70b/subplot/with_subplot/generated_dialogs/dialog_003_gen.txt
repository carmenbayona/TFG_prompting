P1: I'm still waiting for my laptop to arrive and it's been two weeks! I'm extremely frustrated, I really need it for work.

P2: I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. I can see that your order was delayed due to a shipping issue. I'm happy to help you resolve this.

P1: Resolve it? You think an apology will cut it? I have deadlines to meet and I can't even start working without my laptop. Do you know how much I depend on it?

P2: (pausing briefly) I understand, sir. Let me see what I can do. (pause) Actually, I can offer you a refund or a replacement laptop with expedited shipping. Which one would you prefer?

P1: (slightly calming down) Hmm, that's a tough one. If I get a refund, I'll have to wait even longer to get a new laptop. But if I get a replacement, I'm not sure if it'll arrive on time either... Can you guarantee the expedited shipping?
