P1: Hey, I need your help with something. Emma's birthday is coming up and I have no idea what to get her.
P2: Ah, yeah! Birthday gifts can be tough. Um, what about... a nice candle or something?
P1: A candle? I don't know... I feel like that's kinda generic. Does she even like candles?
P2: Well, who doesn't like candles, right? But, seriously, it depends on her style. What's she into these days?
