P1: So, what do you think of the intro? I was trying to set up the whole argument, but I'm not sure if it's clear.
P2: Yeah, it's a good start. I like how you frame the problem, but maybe you could clarify what you mean by "the current methodology". You know, give a few examples?
P1: Examples, right. I was thinking of doing that, but then I got worried it would get too long. Do you think it's necessary?
P2: Honestly, I think it's crucial. Otherwise, it's a bit too vague. By the way, how's the rest of the draft coming along? Are you on track to finish on time?
P1: Yeah, I should be okay. I just want to make sure I'm on the right track. So, what about the literature review? Did I miss anything major?
P2: Actually, I think you did a great job of summarizing the key studies. Although, I have to say, I was a bit surprised you didn't cite Johnson's work. Don't you think it's relevant?
P1: Johnson... hmm, I thought I had considered all the major players. Yeah, maybe I should add that. Thanks for pointing it out.
P2: No problem. That's what I'm here for. You know, I remember when I was working on my thesis, my advisor was always pushing me to consider alternative perspectives. It really helped me strengthen my argument.
