P1: Hey, what's up? I was thinking we could have a movie night tonight. 
P2: Sounds like fun! I'm down. What kind of movie were you thinking of? 
P1: Hmm, I don't know. What are you in the mood for? Action, rom-com, or something else? 
P2: You know, I'm pretty open to anything. What have you seen recently that you'd recommend? 
P1: Well, I've been meaning to see that new Marvel movie. Have you seen it?
