P1: Hi, I just wanted to confirm our travel arrangements for the conference next week.
P2: Ah, yeah... I'm so sorry, I've been meaning to get back to you on that.
P1: No worries, I just want to make sure everything is in place. Did you book our flights yet?
P2: Flights... um... I think so. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, I booked them. We're on the 8 am flight on Monday.
P1: Okay, and what about the hotel? Did you get a confirmation number for our reservation?
P2: Hotel... (pause) I'm so sorry, I think I forgot to book the hotel. Can I do it right now while we're on the phone?
