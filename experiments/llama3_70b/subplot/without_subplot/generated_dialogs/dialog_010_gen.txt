P1: I'm so sorry to bother you, but I think we have a problem with the sink in the kitchen. It's been leaking for a while now.
P2: Ah, yeah, I saw some water on the counter yesterday. I was going to take a look at it today.
P1: Oh, thank you so much! I've been worried sick about it. I don't want it to cause any more damage.
P2: Don't worry, it's an easy fix. I'll just need to tighten the faucet or replace the O-ring. It's not a big deal.
P1: Okay, that sounds great. How long do you think it'll take to fix it? I just want to make sure it's taken care of as soon as possible.
