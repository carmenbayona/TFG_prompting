P1: So, I finally finished my thesis draft and I was wondering if you could take a look and give me some feedback?
P2: Of course, I'd be happy to help. What specifically are you looking for feedback on? The methodology, the literature review, or something else?
P1: Um, yeah... I guess just overall. You know, is it coherent, does it make sense... that kind of thing.
P2: Alright. Well, I've had a chance to read through it, and overall it's a good start. One thing that stood out to me is that your introduction could be stronger. You jump right into the problem statement without setting up the context very well.
P2: Also, I think you could benefit from breaking up some of the longer paragraphs, especially in the discussion section. It's a bit of a dense read right now.
