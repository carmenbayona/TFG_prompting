P1: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my internet connection. It's been dropping out every few minutes.
P2: Oh, great. Not again. I've been dealing with this issue for weeks now. I'm so sick of it.
P1: Yeah, it's really frustrating. I'm pretty sure it's because of the new router we got. I think it's not compatible with our modem or something.
P2: That's what I thought too, but I've already tried swapping it out and it didn't make a difference. I'm starting to think it's a problem with the ISP itself.
