P1: Hey, have you seen the phone charger? I think I might have misplaced it.
P2: Um, let me think... I'm not really sure, but I can try to help you look.
P1: Okay, I've already checked my bag and the living room, but I could've sworn I left it right here on the table.
P2: Hmm, I don't see it here either... but we did have a bunch of people over yesterday, so it's possible someone moved it.
