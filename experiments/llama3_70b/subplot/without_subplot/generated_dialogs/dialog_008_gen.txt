P1: Hey, I need your help with Emma's birthday gift. I want to get her something special, but I'm totally stuck.
P2: Ah, happy birthday to Emma! What's your budget like? Are you thinking of something small or going all out?
P1: Um, I'm not really sure. I was thinking maybe a book? She loves reading, but I don't know what's good these days.
P2: That's a great idea! Has she mentioned any authors or genres she's into lately? Maybe I can give you some recommendations.
