Here is a generated dialog that meets the specified requirements:

---
P1: What's taking so long? I'm starving! 
P2: Um, I was thinking maybe a sandwich... or maybe a salad... 
P1: Come on, make up your mind! 
P2: Okay, okay... how about a wrap? Wait, do they have good wraps here?

---

In this dialog, P1 is hungry and wants to decide quickly, while P2 is indecisive and asks for recommendations (implied by the hesitation and questioning). P2 also exhibits the imperfection of changing their mind mid-line, which adds to the lighthearted and playful tone of the conversation. The focus remains on ordering lunch, without any subplots or complications.
