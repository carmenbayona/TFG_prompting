Here is a clean, minimalistic, and direct conversation that strictly follows the specification:

**Turn 1**
P1: I'm starving. What do you want to order for lunch?
P2: Hmm, I'm not sure. What are you in the mood for?

**Turn 2**
P1: I could eat anything right now. How about you suggest a few options?
P2: Okay... Well, we could get sandwiches or... no, maybe pasta instead.

**Turn 3**
P1: Pasta sounds good to me. Which place do you recommend?
P2: Uh, actually, I was thinking maybe we should get burgers instead...

**Turn 4**
P1: Fine, burgers it is. Where do you want to order from?
P2: Oh, how about that new place that just opened up downtown?
