P1: Oh, sorry to bother you, but I wanted to return that book I borrowed from you a few weeks ago.
P2: What's taking you so long? I've been waiting for it for weeks.

P1: I know, I know, I'm really sorry. Things just got crazy with work and I completely forgot.

P2: (sighs) You always do this. You borrow something and then you just disappear. Remember that time you borrowed my bike and didn't return it for months?

P1: (hesitates) Uh, yeah... about that... I was going through a tough time and I needed the bike to get to my job.

P2: (interrupts) That's not an excuse! You're always making excuses. I don't want to hear about your problems.

P1: (gets defensive) Hey, I'm trying to explain. You're just not listening.

P2: (angrily) I'm listening, all right. I'm listening to how you always put your problems before our friendship.
