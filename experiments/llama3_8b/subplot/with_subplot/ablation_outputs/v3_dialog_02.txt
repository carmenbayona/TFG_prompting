P1: Hey, I'm sorry it took me so long to return the book. I know I borrowed it like, three weeks ago.  
P2: Yeah, no kidding. I've been waiting for it for weeks. You know how I like to read ahead.  
P1: I'm really sorry, Sarah. I got stuck up in a project at work and totally lost track of time.  
P2: Save it, Tom. You're always saying that. You're always late or missing deadlines. And now you're late returning my book.  
P1: Okay, okay. I know I messed up. But I promise I'll return the book today, I just need to drop off some other things at my mom's house.  
P2: Your mom's house? Really? Because I remember you saying the same thing about that time you borrowed my CD and lost it. And then you took ages to replace it, if you even did.  
P1: Ah, come on, Sarah. That was a one-time mistake. And I did replace the CD, eventually. You're not going to make me feel guilty about it.  
P2: Fine. Just return the book and don't mention it again.
