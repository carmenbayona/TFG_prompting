P1: Hey, I'm really sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could return that book I borrowed from you a few weeks ago.

P2: (sighing) What's taking you so long? You said you'd bring it back last week.

P1: I know, I know, I'm really sorry. I've just been super busy with work and stuff. But I promise I'll make it up to you, I'll bring it back tonight.

P2: (interrupting) Busy with work? You're always busy with work. You know, I lent you a CD a few months ago and you lost it. You promised to replace it, but I never heard from you again.

P1: (hesitating) Uh, yeah, I remember that. But that was an accident, and I would've replaced it if I could've found it. This is different, I just got caught up in some stuff and lost track of time.

P2: (repeating themselves) You always say that, "it was an accident," but it feels like it's always an excuse. I'm tired of feeling like I can't trust you.

P1: (excusing) I understand why you'd feel that way, but I swear, this time is different. I'll bring the book back, and I'll even return the CD I lost. Can we please just move forward from here?

P2: (skeptical) Fine. Bring the book back, and we'll see if you're serious about making it up to me.
