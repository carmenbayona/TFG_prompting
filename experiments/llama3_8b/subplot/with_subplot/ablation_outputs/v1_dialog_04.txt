P1: Hey, sorry to bother you but I'm returning this book I borrowed from you a while back.
P2: (sigh) What's taking you so long? You've had it for months.
P1: I know, I'm really sorry about that. I've just been super busy with work and...
P2: Yeah, yeah, work. I've heard it before. You're always busy. (pauses) Anyway, when are you planning to return it?
P1: I swear I'm returning it now. It's just that I got stuck on a project and I didn't have time to drop it off sooner.
P2: (interrupting) You know what? This reminds me of when you borrowed my other book and returned it all crumpled up. I'm still annoyed about that.
P1: Oh, I remember that. I'm really sorry about that too. I'll make sure to be more careful with your stuff from now on.
P2: Just make sure to return things on time for once.
