Here is a generated dialog:

---
P1: Hey, I'm finally returning your book. Sorry it took me so long.  
P2: About time! You borrowed it weeks ago. What's been holding you up?  
P1: I know, I know... I've just been really busy lately. And to be honest, I wasn't really in the mood to read it.  
P2: So, instead, you just ignored me and left me wondering if I'd ever see my book again? That's really frustrating. You know, this isn't the first time you've done this. Remember that time I lent you my sister's phone and you lost it?  
P1: Ah, yeah... I'm really sorry about that. But this is different. I promise I'll be more responsible next time. And I've been thinking, maybe we could exchange books more frequently, so you can have more variety and I won't get stuck with something I'm not interested in.  
P2: (sigh) Fine. Just return the book and let's not talk about this anymore.
