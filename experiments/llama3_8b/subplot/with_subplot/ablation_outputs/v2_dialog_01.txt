P1: Hey, sorry to bother you, but I think I'm going to return this book I borrowed from you a while back. I know I've been putting it off for a bit.

P2: (sighing) Oh boy, here we go again. You're just now returning it? I've been waiting for weeks.

P1: I know, I'm really sorry about that. I've just had a crazy schedule and kept putting it off. But I promise I've been meaning to return it.

P2: (frustrated) Meaning to return it? Meaning to return it? You know how many times I've had to wait for you to return things on time? It's getting old.

P1: I understand where you're coming from, and I'm truly sorry. As for the other times, I know that was a mistake and I won't let that happen again. This time, I really am returning the book.

P2: (still annoyed) Fine. Just take it and get out of here. And don't even get me started on the other time you borrowed my bike and never returned it. That was a whole other level of annoying.

P1: (apologetically) Oh, I'm so sorry about that too. I really feel terrible about it. But I promise to return this book and keep my commitments going forward.

P2: (sighing) Just take it. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
