P1: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late with returning your book. I know I promised to do it last week.

P2: Yeah, you did. And I'm still waiting.

P1: I know, I know. I've just been really busy with work and my mom was in the hospital for a few days.

P2: Your mom was in the hospital? That's not an excuse, P1. You borrowed my book in good faith and you should be able to return it on time.

P1: I know, and I'm really sorry. It won't happen again, I promise.

P2: It better not. You know, this isn't the first time you've had trouble returning borrowed items. Remember that movie you borrowed last summer?

P1: Oh, yeah... about that... I was going to return it, but then I got stuck on a business trip and my luggage got lost and...

P2: [interrupting] Save it, P1. I don't care about your excuses. Just return the book already.

P1: Okay, okay. I'll return it right now. I promise.

P2: See that you do.
