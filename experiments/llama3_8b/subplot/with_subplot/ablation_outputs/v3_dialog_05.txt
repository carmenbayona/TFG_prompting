P1: Hey, I'm finally back from my trip. Guess I should return your book, huh?  
P2: About time! You've been gone for weeks. I've been waiting for it back for ages.  
P1: I know, I know. I'm really sorry. It totally slipped my mind.  
P2: Your mind? You're always saying things like that. Remember that time you borrowed my favorite jacket and kept it for two months?  
P1: Ah, yeah... about that... I was really busy with work and...  
P2: Busy? You were busy? You always say that. Just return the book and apologize already!  
P1: Fine, fine. I'll return it right now. I promise it won't happen again. Can I apologize in person next time, please?
