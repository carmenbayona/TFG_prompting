P1: Hey, I'm so sorry to return this to you late. I know I promised I'd bring it back last week.
P2: (sighs) Yeah, you did. And now it's been a week and a half. What's going on?

P1: I know, I know. Work got crazy and I just completely spaced it out. I've been meaning to bring it back all week but things kept coming up.

P2: (interrupting) Saving the world from work emergencies, huh? You're always doing that, and your friends are always suffering because of it.

P1: (hesitates) Okay, okay, I get it. But can I just explain what happened? I promise I didn't mean to inconvenience you.

P2: (repeats) Inconvenience me? You've done a lot more than that. You know what happened with the book I lent you last semester?

P1: (hesitates) Uh, no... I don't think so. What happened?

P2: You borrowed it and then "lost" it, remember? And now I'm left with no book for my class. You always do this, and I'm tired of it.

P1: (apologetic) I'm really sorry, that was a huge mistake and I feel awful about it. But I promise this won't happen again. Can I please just return this item and make it right?

P2: (sighs) Fine. Return the item. But next time, just be on time for once, okay?
