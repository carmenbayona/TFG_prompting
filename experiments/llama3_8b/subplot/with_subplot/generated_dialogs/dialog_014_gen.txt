P1: Hey, how can I help you with your thesis?

P2: (pausing) Ah, hi... I'm not really sure if I should be asking for help with this, but... I'm having a bit of trouble with my methodology.

P1: Okay, no worries! We've all been there. What specifically is giving you trouble?

P2: (sighs) Well, I'm trying to conduct this experiment, but I'm not sure if the results will be significant enough to support my argument.

P1: That's a valid concern. Let me ask you, what's the main argument you're trying to make in your thesis?

P2: (hesitates) It's... actually, I'm trying to prove that our company's new technology is more efficient than the current one.

P1: Ah, interesting! And what's the hidden motive behind your thesis?

P2: (laughs nervously) Oh, you're really digging deep, aren't you? Fine, I'll admit it. I'm really scared of failing and wasting everyone's time. I don't want to be known as the one who couldn't deliver.

P1: (empathetically) I get it. Failure is a big fear, especially when it comes to something as important as your thesis. But let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen if your experiment doesn't yield significant results?

P2: (thinks) Hmm, I guess I could always revisit my methodology and try again. Or... I could focus on other aspects of the technology that aren't as dependent on the experiment.

P1: Exactly! And that's the beauty of academic research. You can always pivot and adjust your approach. Now, let's brainstorm some ideas for your methodology.
