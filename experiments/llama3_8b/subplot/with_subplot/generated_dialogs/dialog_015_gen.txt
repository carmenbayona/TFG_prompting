P1: Ugh, I'm still trying to figure out this travel plan for the team. Can you help me book these train tickets?

P2: Of course, I'd be happy to help. What's the issue?

P1: The issue is that I thought you were going to take care of it, but it's not done yet. We need to make sure we get the right tickets or we'll be stuck in traffic.

P2: Oh, I apologize for the mix-up. I thought you had it handled. Let me take a look at the schedule.

P1: Yeah, just make sure you get the tickets for the 3 PM train. We can't miss that one.

P2: Okay, got it. So, who's going on this trip again?

P1: Just me, John, and Sarah. We're presenting our project to the client.

P2: Ah, right. I remember now. So, what's the deal with the 3 PM train? Is it a rush hour thing?

P1: Yeah, exactly. We need to get to the client's office before 4 PM. They're pretty particular about timing.

P2: Okay, I think I've got the tickets booked. Can I just double-check something with you?

P1: Sure, what is it?

P2: So, did you want me to book the tickets in our names or under the company?

P1: Oh, good question. Just do it under the company, please.

P2: Alright, done. I sent you a confirmation email.

P1: Great, thanks. I appreciate your help.
