P1: Hey, have you seen my charger? I could've sworn I left it right here.

P2: Ah, sorry to hear that! When was the last time you used it?

P1: Uh, I think it was last night... or was it the night before? I'm really bad with days. Anyway, I know I had it on my desk, but now it's gone.

P2: Okay, let's try to narrow it down. Did you use it at home or here at the office?

P1: Oh, yeah, definitely here at the office. I remember I was working on that report and...

P2: (interrupting) Wait, what's the report about? Maybe I can help you figure out where the charger went.

P1: (laughs) Yeah, yeah, it's just a stupid marketing analysis. But, actually, that's a good idea. You're really good at finding lost things.

P2: (smiling) Thanks, I like to think I'm a bit of a detective. So, what were you doing before you left the office last night?

P1: Hmm... I think I was... (pauses) Ah, wait! I remember! I was talking to Sarah about our project. And then I went to grab a coffee...

P2: (leaning in) And that's when you think you left the charger?

P1: Yeah, that's right! But Sarah might have seen it. I'll go ask her.

P2: Sounds like a plan. (smirks) And if she didn't see it, we can always... (winks) investigate further.

P1: (laughs) Oh, you're a sly one!
