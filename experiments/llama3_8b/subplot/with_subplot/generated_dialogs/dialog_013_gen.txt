P1: Hey, I'm having some issues with my internet connection. Can you help me figure out what's going on?

P2: Ugh, what's wrong now? Can't you see I'm busy trying to meet this deadline?

P1: I know, I know. But this is important. I'm trying to work from home and I really need a stable connection.

P2: Fine, what's happening? Is it the router again?

P1: Yeah, I think so. I mean, it just stopped working out of nowhere. I tried restarting it, but that didn't do anything.

P2: (sighs) Okay, let me take a look. Maybe it's just a loose connection or something.

P1: Okay, thanks. Oh, by the way, I found an old router setup guide in my paperwork. Maybe we can use that to troubleshoot?

P2: (irritated) Yeah, yeah. I know how to set up a router, okay? (mutters under breath) Just what I need, more work...

P1: Okay, sorry. I just thought it might be helpful. So, what do you think is the problem?

P2: (skeptical) I don't know. Maybe you should try resetting the router to its default settings. That usually fixes things.

P1: Okay, yeah. That makes sense. (pauses) Hey, do you think this is because of that new update you installed on the router last week?

P2: (trying to deflect) What update? I didn't install any updates. (accusingly) You're just trying to blame me for your own laziness.

P1: Whoa, hey, no need to get defensive. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this. (pauses) Wait, do you remember installing that update?

P2: (hesitates) Uh, no... I don't think so... (trails off, unable to maintain the lie)

P1: (smirking) Ah-ha! I knew it! You did install that update, didn't you?

P2: (sheepishly) Fine... I did it. But it's not my fault if it didn't work.

P1: (smiling) Well, at least we're making progress. Thanks for owning up to it.

P2: (grumbling) Yeah, yeah... Just fix the router already...
