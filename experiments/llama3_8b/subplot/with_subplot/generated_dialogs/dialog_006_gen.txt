P1: I've been experiencing this weird sensation in my chest, like it's tight and constricted.

P2: Can you describe it in more detail? Is it constant or does it come and go?

P1: It's always there, even when I'm not doing anything physical. Sometimes it feels like it's going to suffocate me.

P2: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make it worse?

P1: (pausing) Honestly, I've been really stressed lately with work and personal stuff... but I don't want to make it sound like I'm just looking for an excuse.

P2: (laughing) I'm here to help, not judge. But it's good that you're acknowledging the stress. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

P1: About a month now. At first, I thought it was just anxiety or a panic attack, but it's been going on for so long...

P2: Okay, let's take a step back. Have you had any health issues in the past that could be related to this?

P1: (hesitating) Well, my grandfather had some heart problems... maybe it's just my imagination, but I feel like I'm going to be next.

P2: (calmly) We'll definitely take that into consideration. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I'd like to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.

P1: (exhaling) Okay, that sounds good. I just want to make sure it's nothing serious...
