P1: Hey, I'm thinking of applying to some master's programs and I was wondering if you could help me out.

P2: Of course! I'd be happy to assist you. What programs are you looking at?

P1: Well, I'm interested in the computer science department at Stanford, but I'm also considering a few other schools. Do you think I'd be a good fit?

P2: That's a great choice! Stanford's program is really competitive, but your skills are impressive. What makes you want to go there specifically?

P1: I've always been fascinated by the research they're doing in AI, and I think it would be a great opportunity to learn from some of the best minds in the field.

P2: That's awesome. I'm sure you'll do great. (pauses) You know, I actually went to Stanford for my master's.

P1: No way! What was your experience like?

P2: It was amazing. I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but the professors and peers were all so supportive. (smiling) I even got to work on a project with one of the professors who ended up being a mentor.

P1: That sounds incredible. I'm a bit worried about the cost, though. Are student loans a big deal for master's programs?

P2: Yeah, they can be, but Stanford has a lot of funding opportunities and scholarships available. Plus, it's an investment in your future, right? (laughs) You'll make it back tenfold.

P1: (laughs) I guess you're right. I just want to make sure I'm making the right decision. What do you think I should do?

P2: Honestly, I think you should apply to a variety of programs and see what sticks. Plus, it'll give you a chance to experience different environments and find the best fit for you.

P1: That's a great idea. Thanks for the advice! I feel a bit more confident now.

P2: No problem, happy to help! (smiling) And hey, who knows, maybe one day you'll be giving advice to someone else.

P1: (laughs) Yeah, maybe so. Thanks again, I really appreciate it!
