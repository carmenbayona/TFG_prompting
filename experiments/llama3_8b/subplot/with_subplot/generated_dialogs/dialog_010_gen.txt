P1: Hey, I'm having some issues with the sink again. It's leaking pretty badly.

P2: (sighs) What's going on now? Can't you just fix it yourself for once?

P1: No, I already tried. That's why I'm calling you. You fixed it last time, and I thought it would be better to have you take a look again.

P2: (muttering under their breath) Great, just great. Like I don't have better things to do...

P1: (noticing P2's tone) Hey, what's wrong? You seem really frustrated. Is it just me being a bother again?

P2: (forced laugh) Oh, no, it's fine. I just... I found out the plumber I fixed the sink last time wasn't licensed, so I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong.

P1: (concerned) Oh no, that's terrible! But I still don't think that's an excuse for the leak to come back. Can you please just come and take a look?

P2: (sighs) Fine. I'll come and fix it. But just so you know, I've been doing some research on sinks and I'm pretty sure I can fix it myself this time.
