P1: Look, I've been trying to get the travel arrangements sorted for our conference trip, but it's been a nightmare. Can you please help me figure out what's going on?

P2: What's going on? You're the one who booked the tickets for the wrong dates. I told you specifically to check the schedule.

P1: I did check! I'm positive I got it right. Maybe there's some mistake on the airline's part?

P2: (sighs) Fine. Let me take a look. (pauses) Yeah, it says here that the flights were changed to the 15th, not the 20th.

P1: Oh, I could've sworn... (trails off) Wait, why didn't you catch that mistake earlier? We're supposed to meet tomorrow afternoon to finalize everything.

P2: (exasperated) Because I was busy dealing with the hotel reservation mix-up, which you also managed to mess up. You're lucky I was able to get us a room after all.

P1: (defensively) Hey, it was one little mistake! You're making a big deal out of it.

P2: (irked) One little mistake? You got us a non-smoking room with a view of the alley. Do you know how much of a hassle that was to resolve?

P1: (sheepishly) Ah, yeah... I didn't realize that was a specific request...

P2: (interrupting) You didn't realize? You didn't realize a lot of things, it seems. Listen, can we just start over and get this trip planned correctly, without any more mistakes?

P1: (hesitates) I... I guess so. Yeah, that would be best.

P2: (firmly) Good. Let's get started then. And next time, please double-check everything before confirming.
