P1: Hey, what's up? I was thinking we could have a movie night tonight.

P2: Ah, sounds fun! But what kind of movie were you thinking of?

P1: Um, I was thinking maybe something light-hearted. You know, a rom-com or a superhero movie.

P2: Okay, that sounds good. But what's the tone of the movie? Is it serious or is it more comedic?

P1: Oh, it's definitely more comedic. You know, I was thinking of that new Marvel movie, the one with the funny jokes and stuff.

P2: Ah, yeah! I saw the trailer for that one. But, wait, isn't that superhero movie a bit...dark? I mean, there's some pretty intense scenes in that trailer.

P1: Yeah, I know what you mean. But trust me, it's not that bad. And besides, I think it's worth watching just for the humor. Plus, I've heard great things about it.

P2: Okay, okay. I'll give it a shot. But if it's too scary, I'm blaming you!
