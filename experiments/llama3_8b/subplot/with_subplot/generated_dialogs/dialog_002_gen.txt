P1: Hey, can you finally confirm the travel arrangements for this trip?

P2: Ah, sorry about that. I was just, uh, trying to get everything organized... (pauses)

P1: Organized? You said that like three days ago. I'm starting to get a little worried we'll miss our flight.

P2: I know, I know. It's just... (hesitates) I've been having some trouble getting in touch with the travel agent.

P1: Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is this because you're still trying to figure out who's paying for this trip? (accusingly)

P2: Oh, no, no, it's nothing like that. (nervously chuckles) It's just... I'm still on the fence about using a different airline.

P1: (skeptical) What's wrong with the airline we booked with?

P2: Well, I found a better deal with another airline... (starts to ramble)

P1: (interrupting) Hold up, let's focus on getting this trip confirmed. Can you please just talk to the travel agent and get the booking done?

P2: (defensively) I am trying, okay? It's just... (pauses) I have a lot on my plate right now.
