P1: Hey, I'm really worried. I think I left my phone charger at home and I need it for work tomorrow.

P2: Don't worry, we'll figure it out. Can you tell me more about where you think you left it?

P1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was on my desk when I was packing for my trip last night, but when I came home today, it was gone.

P2: Okay, let's think this through. Did you have anyone over at your place recently?

P1: Actually, my roommate was over for a bit, but I'm sure they wouldn't take it. They're really responsible. I just wish I could remember where I moved it.

P2: Alright, let's try to retrace your steps. Do you remember what you did after you packed your bag last night?
