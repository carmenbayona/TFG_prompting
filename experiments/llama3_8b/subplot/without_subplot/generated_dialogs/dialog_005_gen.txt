P1: Hey, what do you want to watch for our movie night tonight?

P2: I was thinking of some superhero movie. What's your take on the new Marvel film?

P1: Yeah, that's a good choice! I've been meaning to check it out.

P2: Awesome! I loved the previous installments. Have you seen the trailer?

P1: Yeah, I saw it. I'm just not sure if I want to watch something so action-packed. Do you think we could find something a bit more chill?

P2: There's this rom-com I've been meaning to watch. We could go for that instead?

P1: That sounds nice! What's the movie about?

P2: It's about this couple who reconnect during a trip. It's supposed to be really cute.

P1: That sounds perfect! Let's go for it.
