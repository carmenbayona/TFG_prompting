P1: So, I booked the train tickets online, right?

P2: Ah, yeah, I think there might be a problem. Can you double-check?

P1: Okay, let me just log in real quick. (pause) Huh, it says here that the tickets haven't been booked.

P2: Oh no, I'm so sorry! I completely forgot to book them. Can you please book them for me?

P1: Sure thing! I'll just need to know which train and date you wanted.
