P1: I don't get why we can't just book that hotel I wanted. It's the one you always recommend.

P2: Oh, I think there's been a misunderstanding. We booked the one with the better location.

P1: But I specifically asked for that other one! I checked the reviews and it's supposed to have a fitness center.

P2: I remember you saying that, but I thought you changed your mind. Let me check the booking confirmation.

P1: So you didn't check with me first? That's really frustrating. Can we just change it to the other one?

P2: I apologize for the mistake. Let me see if the other one is available. Yes, it is. I can book it for you.
