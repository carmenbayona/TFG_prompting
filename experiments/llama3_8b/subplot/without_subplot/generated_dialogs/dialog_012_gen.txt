P1: Hey, I've been thinking about applying to a master's program, but I'm not sure if I'm ready yet.

P2: Ah, you're considering it? That's awesome! What's holding you back from applying?

P1: Well, I'm worried about the application process being too competitive and whether I have the right qualifications.

P2: Totally understandable! Competition can be tough, but it's not impossible. Have you looked into the program's requirements and deadlines? I'd be happy to help you go through it if you'd like.
