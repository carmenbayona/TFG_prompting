P1: Hey, I'm having some issues with my sink at home. I'm really concerned about it, and I was wondering if you could help me out.

P2: Yeah, sure thing! What's going on with the sink? Is it leaking or something?

P1: Yeah, it is. Water's coming out from under the sink, and I'm not sure what's causing it. I tried tightening the pipes, but it didn't seem to fix the problem.

P2: Okay, that's a good start. Can you show me where the leak is exactly? And have you noticed any water spots or stains around the sink?

P1: Yeah, it's just under the sink, near the faucet. And yeah, I've seen some water spots on the countertop.

P2: Alright, I think I see. I'm going to take a closer look. (pauses) Ah, I think I found the problem. The faucet's been loose for a while, and that's why the water's been leaking.

P1: Oh, great! I was worried it was something more serious. Sorry again for being such an annoyance.

P2: No worries at all! It's what I'm here for. I'll just tighten the faucet, and that should fix the leak.
