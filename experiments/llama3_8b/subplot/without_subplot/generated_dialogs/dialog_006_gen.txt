P1: Hi, I've been having this headache for a few days now and I'm really concerned about it. It's been bothering me a lot.

P2: Okay, let's take a closer look. Can you tell me more about the headache? Where exactly does it hurt?

P1: Well, it's mostly on the sides of my head, near my temples. And it's been getting worse over the past few days.

P2: I see. And what does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, or does it have a pulsating quality?

P1: Hmm, it's kind of... achy, I guess. It's like my head is just heavy and throbbing all the time.

P2: Okay, that helps. Have you noticed any triggers or factors that might be contributing to the headache? For example, stress, lack of sleep, or certain foods?

P1: Yeah, I've been really stressed out at work lately. And I haven't been sleeping too well either. I usually get 5-6 hours of sleep a night.

P2: I think we can start with looking into those potential stress and sleep-related factors. I'd like to prescribe you a medication to help with the pain and we can also schedule a follow-up appointment to reassess the situation.
