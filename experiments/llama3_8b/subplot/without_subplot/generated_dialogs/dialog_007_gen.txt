P1: Hey, how's it going? You said you wanted to get back on track with your fitness goals?

P2: Ah, yeah... I'm sorry, I've just been so busy lately and I haven't had the time to go to the gym like I should. I feel really guilty about it.

P1: Don't apologize, we all get busy. What are your fitness goals again? Maybe we can break them down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

P2: Right... I wanted to do a 5K in a few months, but now I'm starting to feel like I've fallen really far behind.

P1: Okay, well, let's focus on getting you back to the gym regularly first, and then we can worry about increasing your distance. What do you say we set a goal of going three times a week for the next two weeks?
