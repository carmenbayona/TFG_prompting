P1: Hey, Emma's birthday is coming up, I need some help finding a gift for her. Do you have any ideas?

P2: Ah, yeah! I was thinking we could get her that new book she's been wanting. She's been talking about it for weeks.

P1: Hmm, that's a great idea. But I was also thinking maybe something a bit more personal. You know, something that shows I put some thought into it.

P2: Yeah, definitely. How about we make her a personalized photo album with some of our favorite memories together?

P1: That's perfect! I know she loves looking at old photos and reminiscing. Can you help me pick out some pictures to include in it?
