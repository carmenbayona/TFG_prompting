Here is the generated conversation:

P1: I'm starving! Can we order lunch already?
P2: Hmm, I don't know... I was thinking maybe we could try that new sandwich place that just opened up.

P1: Yeah, I've been there before, it's pretty good. What kind of sandwich are you in the mood for?
P2: Oh, wait, actually, I was thinking more of something light, maybe a salad or something... unless you really want to go for the sandwich.

P1: Okay, a salad sounds good too. How about we compromise and get a salad with some protein?
