P2: Hmm, I'm not sure. What are you in the mood for?

**Turn 2:**
P1: I'm really hungry. Let's get something quick. How about a sandwich?
P2: That sounds okay, but I was thinking maybe we could get something else too...

**Turn 3:**
P1: What do you mean? You just said a sandwich was okay.
P2: Yeah, but I'm also craving something hot. Do they have chicken noodle soup?

**Turn 4:**
P1: Yeah, they do. And it's a great combo. We can get a sandwich and a bowl of soup. Sounds good to me.
P2: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Thank you!
