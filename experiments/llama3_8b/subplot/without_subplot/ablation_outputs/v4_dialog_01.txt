P1: What do you want to order for lunch today?

P2: Hmm, I'm not sure. What are my options?

P1: Well, we have a sandwich shop next door, a salad bar down the street, or we could grab something from the food truck.

P2: I'm tempted by the sandwich shop, but I'm also curious about the salad bar. Can you tell me what's good there?

Let me know if this meets your requirements!
