P1: Hey, I'm starving! What are you in the mood for for lunch?
P2: Mmm, I don't know... maybe something with a salad?

P1: Salad sounds good. What kind of salad are you thinking? Maybe we could get that new place down the street?
P2: Hmm, I was thinking more like... actually, wait, what about that sandwich shop instead?

P1: Sandwich shop? Yeah, their subs are pretty good. Do you want me to order something in particular or just surprise you?
P2: Surprise me, that's fine. Just make sure it's not too spicy, okay?
