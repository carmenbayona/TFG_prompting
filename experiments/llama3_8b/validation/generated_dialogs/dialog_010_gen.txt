P1: Ugh, I'm at my wit's end. The sink is leaking like crazy and I don't know what to do.

P2: Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the leak? Is it dripping or spraying?

P1: It's dripping, but it's really slow, so it's hard to notice at first. But then I saw water pooling on the counter and I was like, "Oh no, this is bad."

P2: Okay, that's good to know. Have you checked the faucet or the drain?

P1: Yeah, I checked the faucet, and it seems fine. I'm not even sure where the water's coming from. I tried to dry it with a towel, but it just keeps coming back.

P2: Hmm, that's weird. Can you show me where the leak is? Sometimes it's hard to see without looking closely.

P1: Yeah, sure. It's... (sound effects) like this. You can see the water dripping onto the counter.

P2: I think I see it now. I'm going to take a closer look. (pause) Yeah, I think I found the problem. The drain is clogged, and that's causing the water to back up.

P1: Oh, that makes sense. But what can we do to fix it? I don't want to have to deal with this again.

P2: Don't worry, it's an easy fix. I can show you how to clean out the drain with a plumber's snake. Or I can take care of it for you if you'd like.

P1: Hmm, I think I can do it myself. But thanks for offering to help.

P2: No problem at all. Just be careful when you're using the snake, and let me know if you have any other questions.

P1: Will do. Thanks again for your help.
