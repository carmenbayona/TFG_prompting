P1: Hey, thanks for agreeing to review my thesis draft. I really appreciate it.

P2: No problem, happy to help. What's the main topic you're writing about?

P1: It's on the impact of social media on mental health. I've been working on this for months, and I'm getting a bit anxious about it.

P2: Ah, that sounds like a really important topic. I've done some research on it myself. So, what specifically do you need feedback on? Just the structure or the whole thing?

P1: Yeah, I'd love to get your thoughts on the overall flow and how well I've supported my arguments. I'm also a bit worried that some of the sections might be too dense.

P2: Okay, let me take a look. Okay, so... hmm... I think you've got some great points here, but I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "cultural homogenization" in this section.

P1: Oh, right! I was trying to say that social media platforms are creating a kind of standardized way of thinking and self-presentation, which is eroding individual identities.

P2: Yeah, that makes sense. But maybe you could clarify that a bit more? And maybe break it up into smaller paragraphs or something?

P1: Yeah, that's a great idea. I'll try to simplify it. What do you think about the conclusion? Is it strong enough?

P2: Actually, I think you've got a great conclusion, but you might want to emphasize the implications a bit more. It feels like you're just summarizing what you've said, rather than really leaving the reader with something to think about.

P1: Ah, good point. I didn't want to overdo it, but I can definitely add a bit more punch to the conclusion.

P2: And what about the references? Have you got a system for keeping track of them?

P1: Uh, not really... I've just been using EndNote and hoping for the best. Is there a better way to do it?

P2: Yeah, I use Zotero myself. It's way more organized and easy to cite. You should totally check it out.

P1: Sounds like a plan. Thanks again for your feedback, it's really helpful.
