P1: Oh my gosh, we're finally going to Hawaii! I've been dying to go there for years.

P2: Sweet! When are you thinking of going?

P1: I was thinking of going in June, but I need to finalize the plans with my family. You know how we always do a big family vacation every year.

P2: Yeah, I remember. So, what's the plan so far? Have you booked anything?

P1: Not yet, but I was thinking of looking into some hotels in Waikiki. I heard it's the best area to stay in.

P2: That's true, but have you considered staying in a condo instead? They're usually more spacious and have a kitchen, which would be really handy for meals and stuff.

P1: Hmm, that's a great idea. I'll look into that too. But what about flights? Have you flown to Hawaii before? How was the experience?

P2: Yeah, I flew there once with my family. It's a long flight, but the scenery is amazing. You get to see the whole Pacific Ocean from the window seat.
