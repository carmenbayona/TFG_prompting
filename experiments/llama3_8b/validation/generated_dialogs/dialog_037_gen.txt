P1: Hey, have you heard about the coffee machine incident this morning?

P2: No, what happened?

P1: So, apparently, someone spilled coffee all over the conference room table, and then just left the mess there.

P2: Ha! Oh man, that's a classic. Who did it?

P1: I have no idea, but I'm sure it'll be all over the office rumors by the end of the day.

P2: Yeah, you know it. I mean, it's not like we don't have better things to do with our time. Hmm, did you notice anything weird about the conference room afterwards?

P1: Like what? Just the usual mess, right?

P2: Well, I thought the carpet looked kinda... faded or something. Like, it was before the spill, but now it's all stained and stuff.

P1: Hmm, that's weird. Maybe it was just me, but I didn't notice that. Did you talk to anyone who was in the conference room?

P2: Just Rachel, and she said it was chaos. People were running around, trying to clean it up, and she didn't even get a chance to grab her notes.

P1: Poor Rachel. I'm gonna go grab her notes and bring them to her.
