P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened at the office yesterday.

P2: What's going on? You sound like you're trying to tell a conspiracy theory.

P1: No, no, it's just... well, I was in the break room, okay?

P2: Okay, what happened in the break room?

P1: So, I was getting my coffee, and I tripped on this cord, right? And it's like, everywhere I went, coffee was flying all over the place.

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that sounds like a total mess!

P1: I know, right? And then, to make it worse, the CEO walks in and sees me covered in coffee, looking like a total idiot.

P2: (laughs) That's like, the ultimate office horror story!

P1: (laughs) I know, right? But you know what the craziest part was?

P2: What's that?

P1: The CEO just starts laughing and says, "Well, I guess this is one way to get a caffeine boost!"

P2: (laughs) That's class, right there.

P1: (laughs) Yeah, I guess it's all about perspective!
