P1: Oh man, I'm so stressed about the deadlines at work! We have this huge project coming up and it's really tight.

P2: What's going on? What's the project about?

P1: It's an audit report for the finance department. We need to get it done by the end of the month.

P2: That's a lot of pressure. How's it going so far? Are you behind schedule?

P1: Yeah, I'm a bit behind, to be honest. I've been putting in extra hours, but I'm still worried I won't make it.

P2: Okay, so what's the holdup? Is it just a matter of gathering all the data or is there something else going on?

P1: Hmm, it's a bit of both, I think. We're getting some data back from the finance team a little slower than expected, and then there's this one tricky section that's taking me forever to finish.

P2: I see. So, what's the tricky section? Is it a specific formula or something?

P1: Yeah, it's a complex formula, and I'm not 100% sure I'm doing it right. I've been double-checking everything, but I'm still not confident.

P2: Okay, maybe we should take a look at it together? I've worked on similar reports before, maybe I can give you some tips.

P1: That would be amazing, thanks! I'd really appreciate the help.
