P1: I'm so frustrated with this new coffee maker I bought. It's a total piece of junk.

P2: Oh no, what's wrong with it?

P1: Well, first of all, it takes forever to brew a cup. And when it finally does, it's always weak. I mean, I've had to reheat the same cup like three times just to get it to taste decent.

P2: Hmm, that does sound annoying. What brand is it?

P1: It's one of those cheap ones from online. I thought I was saving money, but honestly, it's not worth it. And the customer service is terrible too. I've been trying to get a replacement for a week now.

P2: Wow, that's really disappointing. Did you try contacting them through social media or something?

P1: Yeah, I've tried everything. I even went to their store, but they just told me to contact their online support. Like, can't they just make up their minds?

P2: (laughs) Yeah, that does sound frustrating. Maybe I'll avoid that brand if I ever need a new coffee maker.
