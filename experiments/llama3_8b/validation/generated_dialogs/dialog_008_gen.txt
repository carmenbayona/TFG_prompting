P1: Hey, have you thought about what to get Emma for her birthday?

P2: Ah, yeah! I've been trying to come up with something. She's been really into, like, baking and cooking lately.

P1: Yeah, I saw that! She posted some pictures of those cute little cakes on Instagram. Hmm, maybe a cookbook then?

P2: That's a great idea! But, uh, I don't know if she already has like, a million cookbooks. What about a baking class instead?
