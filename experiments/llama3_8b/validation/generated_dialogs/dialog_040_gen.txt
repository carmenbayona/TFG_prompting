P1: Hey, did you hear what happened in the office yesterday?
P2: No, what's going on?
P1: So, apparently, John spilled coffee all over the conference room table during the meeting.
P2: Whoa, that's crazy! What was the meeting about?
P1: Just a regular sales meeting, but I guess John was really nervous or something.
P2: Hmm, that's weird. I've never seen him like that before. Did he get in trouble?
P1: Nah, Karen just laughed it off and told him to calm down. But I heard later that the sales pitch went way off track.
P2: That's so embarrassing! Did anyone take a picture?
P1: Yeah, Emily took a photo, but I haven't seen it yet. I'll have to go through her phone later.
P2: Ooh, can you make sure to get it for me? I want to see that!
P1: Sure thing!
