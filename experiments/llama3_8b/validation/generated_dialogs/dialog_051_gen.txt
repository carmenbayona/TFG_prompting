P1: Hey, how's it going? You've been doing pretty well in class, right?

P2: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I'm not freaking out or anything.

P1: But, uh, I've noticed you've been looking a bit stressed lately. Everything okay?

P2: Yeah, everything's fine. Just a lot of work and stuff. Nothing to worry about.

P1: Okay, cool. But, hey, just so you know, I'm here for you, you know? If you ever need to talk or anything.

P2: Thanks, I appreciate that. But, honestly, I think I just need to, you know, get my priorities straight and stuff.
