P1: Look, I don't understand why the itinerary keeps changing. Can you just confirm our travel plans for next week?

P2: Ah, okay, let's start from the beginning. Who did I talk to about the changes?

P1: I don't know, I just got an email from you saying we're flying out on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.

P2: Hmm, that's weird. I could've sworn I told you to check with me before making any changes. What's the email say?

P1: It just says "new flight schedule" and lists the new departure time. But I was really looking forward to sleeping in on Wednesday.

P2: Oh, I remember now! I had to reschedule our meeting with the client, and I thought it would be better to fly out a day earlier.

P1: But didn't you know I had a doctor's appointment on Tuesday morning?

P2: Ugh, what time was it again? I forgot to write it down.

P1: 9 am. You said it was fine, though.

P2: That's right, you're right. I'm so sorry about the mix-up. Let me check the schedule again real quick.
