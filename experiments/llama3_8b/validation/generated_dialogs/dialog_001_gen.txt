P1: Hey, have you got a minute? I wanted to touch base about our meeting with Johnson on Friday.

P2: Yeah, I'm good. What's up?

P1: I just wanted to make sure we're both on the same page. I sent you that email yesterday about the agenda, right?

P2: Hmm, I think I saw it. Yeah, I got the email. But I haven't had a chance to really dive into it yet.

P1: Okay, no worries. I just wanted to remind you that we need to finalize those financials for the presentation. We can't go in there without those numbers.

P2: Yeah, I know. I'll make sure to get on that. So, what time were we meeting again?

P1: Two o'clock at the conference room. And can you also make sure to send the meeting invite to the whole team? I don't want anyone to miss it.

P2: Got it. Two o'clock, conference room, and I'll send out the invite. Thanks for the reminder, man.
