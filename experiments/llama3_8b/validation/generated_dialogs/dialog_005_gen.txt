P1: Hey, what's up? Want to grab some popcorn and watch a movie tonight?

P2: Oh, yeah! I'm so down for that. What kind of movie were you thinking of?

P1: Hmm, I don't know. What did you see lately that you liked?

P2: Actually, I just watched that new Marvel movie, and it was pretty cool. Have you seen it?

P1: Yeah, I saw it a few weeks ago. I loved the action scenes. But I was thinking maybe something a bit more... romantic?

P2: Ooh, that sounds nice. Like, what, a rom-com or something?

P1: Yeah, that's the idea. I was thinking "When Harry Met Sally" or "The Proposal". What do you think?

P2: Hmm, I've seen "When Harry Met Sally" before, but "The Proposal" sounds good. Can we watch that?

P1: Sounds like a plan to me!
