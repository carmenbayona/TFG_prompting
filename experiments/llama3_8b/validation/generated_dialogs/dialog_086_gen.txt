P1: Hey, can you help me out? I'm trying to get to the city center from here.

P2: Ah, yeah! I can definitely help with that. Where are you coming from?

P1: From the north side of town. I just arrived yesterday and I'm still trying to get my bearings.

P2: Okay, so you're on the right track. You gotta take a left at the traffic light down the street, then keep going straight for about three blocks.

P1: Okay, got it. Left at the light... hmm, which light are you talking about? There's like, three in a row.

P2: Uh, the second one, yeah? The one with the big coffee shop on the corner?

P1: Yeah, that's the one. And then straight for three blocks? That sounds like a long way.

P2: Yeah, it is, but you'll get there. You'll see a big park on your right, then a bunch of shops and restaurants on the left. You can't miss it.

P1: Alright, thanks so much! I think I can handle it from here.
