P1: Hey, have you ever hiked at Red Rock Canyon?

P2: No, I've always wanted to, but I never had the chance. What's it like?

P1: It's amazing! The views are incredible, and the trails are pretty challenging. I was thinking of going this weekend, wanna join me?

P2: Hmm, I'd love to, but I've got a ton of work to catch up on. Can we make it next weekend instead?

P1: Yeah, that works for me. We can leave early Saturday morning and make a day of it. There's a new trail I want to try out.

P2: Sweet! I've been meaning to get some exercise, so that sounds great. What time were you thinking of leaving?

P1: How about 7 am? We can grab breakfast at that new diner near the trailhead.

P2: Sounds like a plan. Can you send me the details of the trail and meet-up spot?

P1: Yeah, sure thing. I'll send you a text with all the deets. Looking forward to it!
