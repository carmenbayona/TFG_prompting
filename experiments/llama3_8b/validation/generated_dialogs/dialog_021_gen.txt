P1: Hey, did you hear about the coffee machine in the break room?
P2: No, what's going on?
P1: So, someone spilled an entire cup of coffee all over the floor and nobody bothered to clean it up. It was like a war zone.
P2: (laughs) That's crazy! And I thought I was the only one who hated that machine. What's the worst part?
P1: The worst part is that our boss came in and tried to "accidentally" kick it, like, three times. I was like, "Dude, it's not a soccer ball!"
P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's rich. Did anyone report it to facilities?
P1: No, I think we're just hoping it'll magically fix itself. Maybe we should start a petition.
