P1: Honestly, I'm so done with this job. I just feel like I'm wasting my time here.

P2: What's going on? You seem really upset.

P1: It's just the same old thing every day. I feel like I'm not making any progress, and nobody cares. I'm just a cog in a machine.

P2: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Have you talked to your manager about this?

P1: Yeah, I have. And they just give me the same old speech about how the company is going through a tough time and we all need to pitch in. Like, I get it, but it's been a year already!

P2: Yeah, that can be really demotivating. But have you considered trying to find a solution within the company? Like, maybe you could take on a new project or role?

P1: Ugh, no way. I've tried that already. Trust me, it's not gonna make a difference. I'm just done.

P2: Okay, well, I understand why you'd feel that way. But before you make any rash decisions, can I ask, have you thought about how quitting would affect your career?

P1: Career? Are you kidding me? I've been thinking about this for weeks, and I'm just so over it. I need to get out of here before I lose my mind.

P2: Okay, okay. I get it. But just take a deep breath and let's think this through together, okay?
