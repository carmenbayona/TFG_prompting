P1: Oh man, I'm so frustrated. I lost my wallet somewhere between work and home yesterday.

P2: Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? When did you notice it was missing?

P1: Uh, I think it was around 5 pm. I was walking to the subway and I must've dropped it. I was in a rush, so I didn't notice until I got home and my phone was dead.

P2: Okay, got it. So, have you checked with anyone or anywhere to see if it's been turned in?

P1: I talked to my coworkers, but no one's seen it. I also checked with the subway station, but they haven't found it either.

P2: Alright, let's try to think this through. Did you have your wallet on a chain or anything? Maybe someone handed it in thinking it was a lost ID or something.

P1: Yeah, it was attached to my belt loop. I always wear it that way. But I don't think anyone would know to look for it specifically.

P2: Okay, so we should probably report it to the police and give them a description. I can help you with that if you want.

P1: Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks for your help so far.
