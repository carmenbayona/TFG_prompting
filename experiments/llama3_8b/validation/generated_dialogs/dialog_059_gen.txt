P1: Ah, man, I'm so frustrated. I think I lost my wallet.

P2: Oh no, that's terrible! Where was the last place you remember having it?

P1: Uh, I think it was at that new coffee shop downtown. I grabbed a coffee and then went to the park. But when I got to the park, it was gone.

P2: Okay, let me think. Did you check your pockets, like, thoroughly?

P1: Yeah, like, a zillion times. I'm starting to think I must have left it at the coffee shop.

P2: Hmm, that's a good point. Can you try calling them and see if anyone turned it in?

P1: Yeah, I just called. They said they haven't found it. But I'm gonna go back there and ask if anyone remembers anything.

P2: Good idea. And if that doesn't work, we can try looking around the park again.
