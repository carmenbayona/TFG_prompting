P1: Oh man, have you heard about the new concert venue that just opened up downtown?
P2: Yeah, I saw some ads on social media, but I haven't had a chance to check it out yet.
P1: You gotta go! I saw The Chordas last weekend and it was insane! The sound system is top-notch.
P2: Whoa, The Chordas? I've been meaning to see them live! How was the energy at the venue?
P1: Electric! The crowd was singing along to every song. And the staff was super friendly too.
P2: That's awesome. I'll have to add it to my list of places to check out. Did you have a favorite part of the concert?
P1: Hmm, that's a tough one. But I think it was when they played "Echoes in the Dark" - the whole crowd just erupted.
P2: Yeah, that's a great song! I love their newer stuff.
