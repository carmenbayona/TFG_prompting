P1: Hey, did you hear about what happened in marketing today?

P2: No, what's going on?

P1: Oh, it's just that John spilled coffee all over the conference room table during the meeting with the new client. I mean, it was like a mini-flood!

P2: (laughs) Oh no, that's crazy! What did the client think?

P1: Hmm, I don't know. I didn't stay to find out. But I heard the marketing team is still trying to clean up the mess. I'm just glad I wasn't there to witness it.

P2: (giggles) I can imagine. Poor John. He's always been a bit of a clumsy guy, hasn't he?

P1: (laughs) Yeah, it's not the first time he's had a little mishap. But still, you'd think he'd be more careful with the coffee. I mean, it's not like it's the first time he's seen a conference room.

P2: (sympathetic tone) Yeah, I guess so. Well, I hope he's okay and that the client isn't too mad.

P1: Oh, I'm sure it's all good. I mean, it's not like it was a huge deal or anything. Although, I have to admit, it was pretty funny watching him try to clean it up.

P2: (laughs) Yeah, I can imagine. Well, I'm glad I didn't miss it, even if it was just a minute.
