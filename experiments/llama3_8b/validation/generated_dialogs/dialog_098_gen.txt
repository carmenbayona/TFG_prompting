P1: Dude, I'm so stoked to be talking about my job interview experience! I just got out of this crazy interview yesterday.
P2: That's awesome! Tell me more about it! What was the company like?
P1: Hmm, yeah... it was actually a really cool startup. I met with the CEO, and he was super down-to-earth.
P2: That's great to hear! So, what made you apply for the job?
P1: Well, I've been following their work for a while, and I'm really passionate about their mission. Plus, the company culture seemed super relaxed, which I loved.
P2: That's really interesting. So, what happened during the interview that you're still thinking about?
P1: Yeah... so they asked me this weird behavioral question, and I'm not sure if I answered it right. It was like, "Tell me about a time when..."
P2: Yeah, those questions can be tough. What did you say?
P1: Uh, I think I kind of butchered it. I started talking about this one project I worked on, but I'm not sure it was relevant to the question.
P2: Hmm, maybe we can go over it and figure out what you meant to say. What was the project about?
