P1: So, you want to know about ordering at a restaurant, huh?
P2: Yeah, I've never been to a fancy place before. I don't know what to expect.
P1: Okay, well, first of all, you gotta know that most restaurants have a menu, of course. But sometimes they'll have specials too.
P2: Like, what kind of specials? Is it like a daily special or something?
P1: Yeah, exactly. Some restaurants will have a daily special, and it's usually something the chef wants to highlight.
P2: Oh, like a featured dish? And how do I even know what it is?
P1: Good question. Sometimes they'll have a little sign that says "Daily Special" or something like that. Or the waiter will just tell you about it.
P2: Okay, that makes sense. But what if I don't like seafood? Can I still get the special?
P1: Absolutely. I mean, not all specials are seafood-based, unless it's a seafood restaurant, of course.
