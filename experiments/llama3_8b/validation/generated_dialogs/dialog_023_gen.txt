P1: Hey, guess what just happened at the office?

P2: What's up? Sounds like the usual Monday chaos?

P1: No, no, it's way worse than that. I walked in this morning and found that our CEO's office was flooded!

P2: What?! How did that even happen?

P1: Apparently, someone left the water cooler on overnight and the whole thing just overflowed. 

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's a new one. Did anyone get in trouble for it?

P1: Yeah, the maintenance guy is freaking out trying to clean up the mess. But you know what the funniest part is?

P2: What is it?

P1: Our CEO's "important" files were all soaked. I mean, who keeps important documents on their desk, right?

P2: (laughs) Only our CEO. So, was the whole office evacuated or anything?

P1: Nah, we just had to move the meeting to the conference room. But I'm pretty sure I saw Karen from HR trying to salvage some soggy papers.

P2: (laughs) That's Karen for you. Alright, well, I'm glad it's not a bigger deal. Maybe we'll get a free cleaning service out of it!
