P1: Hey, how's it going? You seem a bit off lately.

P2: I'm fine, just tired, that's all.

P1: Tired? You've been working non-stop for weeks, and you're always running on fumes. You need to take a break, you know.

P2: I know, I know. But I just have so much to get done, and my deadlines are looming. I don't know how I'm going to meet them.

P1: Okay, okay. But you can't keep pushing yourself like this. You're going to burn out. Why don't we take a walk or something to clear your head? You can tell me what's going on and we can figure something out together.

P2: Nah, I don't know... I really should be getting back to work. It's almost Friday and I need to get this done.

P1: Fine, but just for the record, I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. You're not a machine, you know. You need to take care of yourself too.
