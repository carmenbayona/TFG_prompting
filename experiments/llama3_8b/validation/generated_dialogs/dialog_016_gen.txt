P1: Hey, I'm thinking of trying out that new Italian place downtown. Have you been there?

P2: Oh, yeah! I went there last weekend with my family. It was amazing!

P1: Really? What did you think of the food?

P2: The pasta dishes are incredible. And the service was super friendly too. I got the carbonara, and it was so rich and creamy... hmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

P1: Mmm, that sounds good. How was the atmosphere? Was it pretty busy?

P2: Yeah, it was pretty full, but it didn't feel too loud or overwhelming. They have these huge windows that let in so much natural light, it's really nice. And the decor is super cozy, too.

P1: That sounds perfect. I'll definitely have to try it out. Did you try the desserts?

P2: Oh, yeah! We got the tiramisu, and it was to die for! You gotta try it when you go.
