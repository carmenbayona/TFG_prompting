P1: Oh my god, guys, I have the most amazing news! I just got an internship offer at Google!

P2: Whoa, that's incredible! Congratulations, man! You must be stoked!

P1: I am, I am! I'm still in shock, to be honest. I really didn't expect it, but I'm so grateful for the opportunity.

P2: That's awesome, dude! You've been working towards this for so long. What's the internship going to be for?

P1: Ah, it's in the data science team, and I'll be working on some really cool projects with a mentor who's a leading expert in the field.

P2: That sounds like a dream come true! I'm sure you're going to crush it. What made you decide to apply to Google in the first place?

P1: Honestly, I've always been a huge fan of their work, and I knew it would be an amazing learning experience. Plus, their campus is just incredible â€“ have you seen those slides?

P2: Haha, yeah, I've seen some pictures! So, what's the plan now? When do you start?

P1: I start in a few weeks, and I'm planning to move to the Bay Area for the summer. I'm a bit nervous about leaving home, but I know it'll be worth it.

P2: You'll do great, man. You're going to miss us, though.
