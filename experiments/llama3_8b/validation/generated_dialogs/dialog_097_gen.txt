P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked we're planning a group project! I've been thinking about it nonstop since the professor announced it.

P2: Yeah, me too! I've been wondering what kind of topic we're gonna tackle. Have you given it some thought?

P1: Totally! I was thinking maybe we could do something on environmental sustainability, but I'm also open to other ideas. What are your thoughts?

P2: Hmm, that's a great idea. I've actually been looking into sustainable fashion, and I think we could do something really cool with that.

P1: Whoa, that's awesome! I didn't know that was something people were doing. So, what's your vision for the project? Like, what kind of deliverables are you thinking?

P2: Well, I was thinking maybe we could do a video series or something, where we interview people from different industries and showcase their sustainability practices.

P1: That's a genius idea! And it could be really visually appealing. I can totally see it. Oh, one thing though â€“ have you talked to Sarah yet? I was thinking we should get her on board, she's super into this stuff.

P2: Nah, I haven't talked to her yet. But I'll reach out to her later today. So, do you think we should start brainstorming some more ideas or what?
