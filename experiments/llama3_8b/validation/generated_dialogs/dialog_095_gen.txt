P1: Oh my gosh, I'm so excited! You won't believe what I did for Sarah's birthday yesterday!

P2: What did you do? What's going on?

P1: I planned this huge surprise party with her friends and family. It was a total secret, even from her.

P2: Whoa, that's crazy! How did you manage to keep it a secret?

P1: Yeah, it was tough. I had to sneak around and make all the arrangements when no one was looking. But it was worth it when she walked into the room and saw everyone wearing party hats and blowing up balloons.

P2: Aw, that's so sweet! Did she like it?

P1: Oh, yeah! She was totally surprised and shocked. It took her a few minutes to even process what was going on. And then she started crying and hugging everyone.

P2: That's amazing! I wish I could've been there. Did you take any photos?

P1: Yeah, tons of them! I'll send you some later. But you have to promise not to post them on social media without Sarah's permission.

P2: Scout's honor! I won't say a word.
