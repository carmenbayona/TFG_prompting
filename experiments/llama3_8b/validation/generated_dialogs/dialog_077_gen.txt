P1: Oh man, I'm freaking out, I still haven't started that assignment and it's due tomorrow, I think?

P2: Whoa, hang on, let's take a deep breath. When do you need to submit it? Is it really tomorrow?

P1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure, but I've been going through all my notes and I just can't find the due date anywhere. It's like it vanished.

P2: Okay, okay, don't worry. Let me check the syllabus real quick. (pause) Ah, yeah, it says here that it's due by 11:59 PM tonight. You can still make it.

P1: Oh, thank God! I was sure I was going to fail. But wait, what's with the 11:59 PM thing? Can it really be that late?

P2: Yeah, the professor is pretty cool about it. He just wants us to get it done, not have it perfect. Plus, it's not like we're getting it in at midnight or anything.

P1: Okay, okay, I think I can handle that. But can you just confirm with me that you're sure about the due date? I don't want to risk it.

P2: Absolutely, I checked it twice. You're good to go!
