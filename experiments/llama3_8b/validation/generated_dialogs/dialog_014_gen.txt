P1: Hey, how's your thesis going? You said you were struggling with the methodology, right?

P2: Yeah... I don't know why I even decided to do it this way. It's just not working out.

P1: Well, maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together. What specifically is giving you trouble?

P2: Hmm, I don't know where to even start. I feel like I've already tried everything.

P1: Okay, let's take a step back. What's the main question your thesis is trying to answer?

P2: Oh, I think it's supposed to be about the impact of social media on mental health.

P1: Okay, so we're looking at the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. That's a pretty broad topic.

P2: Exactly, and I'm having trouble narrowing it down. I don't want to end up with a bunch of irrelevant data.

P1: Yeah, that's a good point. Why don't we try to focus on one specific aspect of the relationship? For example, are you looking at the correlation between social media addiction and depression?

P2: Yeah, that makes sense. But how do I even measure social media addiction?

P1: Ah, that's a great question. We could use something like the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, or maybe even a survey to get a better sense of people's habits.

P2: Hmm, I didn't think of that. Thanks, I think I can work with that.
