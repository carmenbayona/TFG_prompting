P1: Hey, have you heard what happened in the office yesterday?
P2: No, what's going on?
P1: Apparently, John spilled coffee all over the new CEO's laptop.
P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's hilarious! Did he get fired or something?
P1: (laughs) No, no, thankfully not. But the CEO was not happy, let's just say.
P2: (chuckles) I bet. So what happened after that?
P1: Well, John was in a meeting with the whole team, and he just got up and walked out, not even noticing it.
P2: (laughs) That's gold! I can totally picture it.
P1: (laughs) Yeah, it was pretty chaotic. And then someone else spilled water all over the conference room carpet, so...
P2: (laughs) This is getting better and better! What's the headcount on the office coffee cups today?
P1: (laughs) I think we're at, like, 12 already.
