P1: Hey, how's it going? I heard there's an update on the presentation.

P2: Ah, yeah, there is. I was going to send it out to the team today.

P1: Awesome, I'm excited to see what's changed. I've been working on my slides all morning.

P2: Yeah, it's a pretty big update. We're moving the deadline up a week.

P1: Whoa, that's a big change. What's the reasoning behind that?

P2: Well, the client is pushing for an earlier release and we're trying to accommodate their requests.

P1: Okay, that makes sense. But what about the impact on our workload?

P2: Honestly, I'm a bit worried about that. We're going to have to work a bit more efficiently to meet the new deadline.

P1: Yeah, I can see that. But I'm sure we can make it work. Can I take a look at the updated presentation?

P2: Yeah, I've got it right here. Let me just send it over to you.
