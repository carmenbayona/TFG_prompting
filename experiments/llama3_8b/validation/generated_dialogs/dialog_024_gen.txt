P1: Hey, you won't believe what just happened at the office!

P2: What's going on?

P1: So, apparently, Dave spilled coffee all over the CEO's laptop during the morning meeting.

P2: Oh no, that's a great way to start the day. Did he get fired on the spot?

P1: Ha! No, surprisingly, the CEO just laughed it off and told Dave to get it cleaned up. But, uh, the real excitement was when Karen tried to "help" by pouring an entire bottle of water on the laptop to "clean" it.

P2: Hmm, I can already see this getting out of hand. Did Karen get in trouble?

P1: Yeah, the CEO was not amused. But the best part is, Dave's been trying to get out of cleaning it up all day, saying it's "company property" or something ridiculous like that.

P2: That's classic Dave. Did he really think that would work?

P1: I know, right? I'm still laughing about it. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if anyone else tries to "help" with their own special brand of genius.

P2: I'm sure it'll make for a great watercooler conversation.
