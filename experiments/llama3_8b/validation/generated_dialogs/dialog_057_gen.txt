P1: Oh, Rachel, have you ever thought about taking a pottery class?

P2: Hmm, actually, I've been wanting to try it out for ages! What made you think of it?

P1: I just signed up for one last weekend and it was so much fun, you know? I got to make this really cool mug and it was just super relaxing.

P2: That sounds amazing! I love the idea of getting creative and taking a break from work. Who's your instructor?

P1: Her name is Karen, and she's super nice and patient. I'm sure you'll love her. You should totally come with me!

P2: Yeah, that would be great! Can I get the details, like when and where?
