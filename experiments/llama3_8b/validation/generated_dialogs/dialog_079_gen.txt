P1: Ugh, I'm so annoyed with myself. I completely forgot my umbrella this morning and now I'm soaked.

P2: Aw, don't be too hard on yourself! It happens to the best of us.

P1: Yeah, but I was really looking forward to getting some fresh air on my walk to work. Now I'm all wet and miserable.

P2: Well, why don't we get you changed into some dry clothes and then we can figure out how to get you another umbrella?

P1: That sounds like a plan. But I'm still fuming about how I could be so careless. I mean, I set my alarm and everything...

P2: Hmm, maybe you were just running on autopilot this morning? It's easy to zone out sometimes.

P1: Yeah, that could be it. Although, I did get stuck behind that huge truck on the highway, which was just awful.

P2: Ugh, traffic woes are the worst! Okay, so let's focus on getting you dry and warm first. Then we can worry about the umbrella. Sound good?

P1: Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks for listening and offering to help. You're a lifesaver!

P2: No problem at all! We're all about looking out for each other here.
