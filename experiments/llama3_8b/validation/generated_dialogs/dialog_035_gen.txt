P1: Hey, did you hear about the crazy thing that happened in the office?

P2: No, what's going on?

P1: So, I was walking down the hallway, and I saw our boss's office door wide open. I was like, "Oh no, she must be going through some stuff."

P2: Hmm, that's weird. Did she seem upset or anything?

P1: Actually, yeah, she was frantically searching for something. I was about to go in and offer some help, but then I saw our coworker, John, walking out with a bunch of files.

P2: John? What was he doing in her office?

P1: I have no idea, but I'm sure it's not good. I mean, our boss is usually pretty organized, so to see her like that... it was pretty amusing, to be honest.

P2: (laughs) Amusing? You think it's funny?

P1: Well, not like, haha, something's going on, but more like, this is going to be an interesting situation.
