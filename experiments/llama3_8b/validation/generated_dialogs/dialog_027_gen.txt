P1: Hey, have you heard about what happened in the office yesterday?

P2: What are you talking about?

P1: You know, the whole mess on the second floor. I was walking by and saw people freaking out.

P2: Hmm, no idea what you're talking about. Was it a fire drill or something?

P1: No, it was nothing like that. Apparently, someone spilled coffee all over the conference room and it got everywhere.

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's gonna be a real pain to clean up. Who did it?

P1: I think it was Rachel. I saw her rushing out of there with a look of pure terror on her face.

P2: (chuckles) Yeah, Rachel can be a bit of a klutz sometimes. Did anyone get hurt?

P1: No, luckily not. Just a lot of coffee and chaos. I'm just glad I was on the other side of the floor or I would've been right in the middle of it.

P2: (laughs) Oh, that's a close call! I'm gonna have to go check it out. Thanks for filling me in!
