P1: Hey, did you hear about the thing that happened in the office yesterday?

P2: What thing? What's going on?

P1: You know, the coffee machine exploded or something. I mean, it was like a mini-eruption.

P2: Wait, what?! That's crazy! Did anyone get hurt?

P1: No, thankfully not. But the whole area was covered in coffee grounds and there was this huge mess.

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's insane. So, what happened? Was it a faulty machine or something?

P1: Yeah, apparently the thing just malfunctioned. Some guy from facilities came to clean it up and he said it was a miracle nobody was badly hurt.

P2: (laughs) I can imagine. And what about the smell? Was it... awful?

P1: (laughs) Oh, you have no idea. It was like someone poured coffee all over the carpet. Took 'em hours to clean it up.
