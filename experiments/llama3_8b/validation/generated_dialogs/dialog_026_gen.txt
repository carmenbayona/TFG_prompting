P1: So, you heard about the crazy thing that happened in the office yesterday, right?

P2: Yeah, what happened? I heard something weird, but I didn't get the whole story.

P1: Okay, so apparently, John from HR spilled coffee all over his shirt and then tried to hide it with a napkin... (laughs) I mean, I've seen some amateur attempts at covering up stains, but this was something else.

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's classic. What was he doing? Was he in a meeting or something?

P1: No, he was just walking down the hallway, and I was like, "dude, you're on fire!" (laughs) But seriously, it was pretty embarrassing for him.

P2: Poor guy. Did anyone help him clean it up?

P1: Yeah, Sarah from marketing came over and tried to help him, but it was like a mini-mess everywhere. I'm just glad no one else got involved... that would've been a whole other story! (laughs)

P2: (laughs) Oh, I can imagine. So, what did John do after that?

P1: He basically just stood there looking like a deer in headlights for like five minutes before someone came and took him to the conference room to clean up. I was like, "dude, it's just coffee, relax!" (laughs)

P2: (laughs) Yeah, I can see how that would be pretty embarrassing.
