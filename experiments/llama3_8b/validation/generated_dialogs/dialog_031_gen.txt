P1: Hey, guess what just happened at the office?

P2: What's up? Sounds interesting.

P1: So, the CEO's coffee mug got knocked over and spilled all over her new white shirt.

P2: Oh no, that's awkward! What happened?

P1: Apparently, some intern was trying to rush past her with a bunch of papers, and... whoops! Next thing you know, the CEO's giving him a death stare.

P2: Ha! That's quite a look. Did he apologize or what?

P1: Yeah, he was pretty mortified. He's still trying to clean up the mess. I was walking by and saw the whole thing go down.

P2: That's hilarious. I'm surprised she didn't fire him on the spot.

P1: Yeah, I wouldn't have blamed her. But I guess she's trying to keep a level head. You know, for morale and all that.

P2: Yeah, that's probably a good idea. So, how was your day otherwise?

P1: Oh, you know, just the usual chaos. Meetings and emails and stuff. Nothing too exciting.

P2: Same here. Just trying to keep my head above water.
