P1: Hey, I got back from that job interview and I'm still trying to process everything.

P2: Oh, sorry to hear that. How'd it go?

P1: Honestly, I'm not really sure. They said I was a strong candidate, but they went with someone else.

P2: Aw, that's tough. You must be really disappointed.

P1: Yeah... I was really hoping to get that job. I've been looking for so long, you know?

P2: Of course, I do. And it's not like it's easy to find a job these days. You're definitely not alone.

P1: I know, but it's hard not to take it personally. I mean, I thought I nailed the interview.

P2: You probably did. It's not like they rejected you because you're not qualified or anything.

P1: Exactly! I was thinking, maybe I should try to follow up with them, see if I can get some feedback or something.

P2: Yeah, that's not a bad idea. And even if they can't give you feedback, it's good that you're not giving up.

P1: Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, Sarah. Just talking to you makes me feel a little better.

P2: Aw, anytime, buddy. That's what friends are for.
