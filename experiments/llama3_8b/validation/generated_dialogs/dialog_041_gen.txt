P1: Hey, have you tried that new yoga class at the studio downtown?

P2: Yeah, I've been thinking about it. What's the vibe like?

P1: Oh, it's amazing! The instructor is so relaxed and knowledgeable. And the studio itself is super clean and calming.

P2: Hmm, that does sound nice. What kind of yoga do they offer?

P1: All sorts! Vinyasa, Hatha, even Restorative. And they have special classes for beginners, which is awesome.

P2: Cool. I've been meaning to try something new. Do they have any packages or deals right now?
