P1: Hey, have you been watering the plants lately?

P2: Uh, no... I'm so sorry, I've been really busy and I just keep forgetting.

P1: Forgetting? That's not like you, what's going on?

P2: I don't know, I feel really guilty about it too. I just get caught up in work and stuff.

P1: Yeah, I know how it is. But the plants are really suffering, they need water so badly. Can you please make sure to water them tomorrow?

P2: Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. I promise. I'll even set a reminder on my phone.
