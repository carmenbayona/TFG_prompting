P1: Hey, did you catch the game last night?

P2: No, I was too busy with work. What happened?

P1: Oh, it was insane! The underdog team won in overtime, and the crowd went wild. I was screaming at the TV, dying laughing.

P2: Whoa, that sounds intense! What was the final score?

P1: I think it was 32-28, but I recorded it, we should watch it together sometime. By the way, have you seen the highlights on ESPN?

P2: Hmm, I haven't had a chance yet. Are they doing a special on the playoffs?

P1: Yeah, they're showing the top plays from the season. I caught a few minutes of it earlier and saw some crazy stuff. You should totally tune in, it's gonna be epic.

P2: Sounds like a plan. Will it be on tonight?

P1: Yeah, they're doing a special broadcast at 8 o'clock. You can set a reminder, it'll be worth it, trust me.
