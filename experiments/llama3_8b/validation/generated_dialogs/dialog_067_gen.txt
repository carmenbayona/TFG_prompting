P1: Hey, I'm really struggling lately. I feel like I'm just going through the motions every day without any sense of purpose.
P2: Oh, sorry to hear that. What's going on? Is everything okay at work or home?
P1: It's just... my mom's been sick for a while now, and it's taking a toll on me. I feel guilty for not being able to do more to help her, you know?
P2: Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be really tough for you. But you're not alone, okay?
P1: Yeah, I know, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm failing her somehow. Like, I should be doing more to support her, but I just can't seem to find the energy or the motivation.
P2: I get it. Sometimes it feels like we're just trying to keep our heads above water, you know? That's a lot of pressure to be carrying around. Do you think talking about this is helping at all?
P1: Hmm, I don't know... I guess it's helping a little. Just having someone to talk to about this is... it's a relief, I suppose.
P2: That's exactly what I'm here for. I'm not going anywhere, and you're not alone in this.
