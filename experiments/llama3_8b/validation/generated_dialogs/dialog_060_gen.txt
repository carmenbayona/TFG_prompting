P1: Hey, what's up? I'm starving. What do you feel like eating tonight?

P2: Nah, not much. Just had a big lunch. How about you suggest something?

P1: Hmm, okay. I was thinking maybe we could grab some pizza. There's that new place downtown that just opened up.

P2: Yeah, I've heard of it. Is it any good? I don't want to waste my money if it's just gonna be some generic chain pizza.

P1: Well, I've heard mixed reviews, but I'm down to try it out. Plus, it's not every day we get a new spot around here.

P2: Okay, sure. But only if you're buying. I'm still full from lunch.
