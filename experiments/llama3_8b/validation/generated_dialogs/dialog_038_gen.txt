P1: Hey, have you heard about the office incident last night?

P2: No, what happened? Is everyone okay?

P1: Yeah, nothing too serious, but there was a bit of a mess in the break room. Someone spilled coffee all over the files and the microwave was on fire.

P2: Whoa, that sounds intense! Do you know who did it?

P1: Uh, no, I don't think anyone's claiming responsibility. I just saw the mess when I came in this morning. I'm not sure how it happened.

P2: Hmm, that's weird. Did you notice anything else out of the ordinary? Like, was the door open or anything?

P1: Yeah, the door was open, and I think I saw the janitorial cart parked outside, so maybe someone was grabbing some supplies or something.

P2: Okay, got it. So, just to confirm, it looks like an accident, right? And it didn't seem like anyone was trying to cause trouble?

P1: Exactly. I mean, it's just one of those weird things that happens sometimes.
