P1: Oh man, you won't believe what happened at the office today.

P2: What's going on?

P1: So, John from HR spilled coffee all over the conference room table during the morning meeting. I mean, it was a real mess.

P2: That's crazy! What happened next?

P1: Well, Karen from marketing tried to help clean it up, but she knocked over a plant and now there's water all over the carpet.

P2: (laughs) That's just great. Did anyone get in trouble?

P1: Not yet, but I heard John is getting an earful from management. And poor Karen is freaking out because she thinks she's going to get in trouble for "making it worse".

P2: (chuckles) Yeah, that sounds like Karen. But what's the plan for the rest of the day? Is the meeting getting rescheduled?

P1: Yeah, we're moving to the break room instead. And get this â€“ the CEO is actually going to do a walk-through to "inspire" us, even though the conference room is basically unusable.

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's rich.
