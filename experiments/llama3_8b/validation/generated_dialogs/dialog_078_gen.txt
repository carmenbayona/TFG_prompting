P1: Dude, have you heard about the new caf√© that just opened up downtown?

P2: No, I haven't. What's it like?

P1: It's amazing! I went there with my friends yesterday and we had an incredible time. The coffee is so good, and the atmosphere is super cozy.

P2: Hmm, that sounds nice. What kind of food do they serve?

P1: Oh, they have a really interesting menu. I had this one pastry that was like a croissant and a danish rolled into one, and it was incredible.

P2: That sounds weird, but also kind of intriguing. How's the price point?

P1: Actually, it's really reasonable. I think we spent like 20 bucks in total, and that was with a bunch of drinks and snacks.

P2: Alright, you've sold me. When were you thinking of going back?

P1: We should go this weekend! I'll even invite you and we can make a day of it.

P2: Sounds like a plan to me.
