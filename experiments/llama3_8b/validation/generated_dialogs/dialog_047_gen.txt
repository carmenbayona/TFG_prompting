P1: Hey, what's going on with you lately? You seem really distracted.

P2: Oh, I'm fine, just been really busy with work. Trying to meet some deadlines.

P1: Deadlines, huh? You're stressing about those, right? I can tell when you're worried.

P2: Yeah, a bit. It's just that my boss is breathing down my neck, and I'm not sure if I can get everything done on time.

P1: I see. So, it's more about the pressure and the uncertainty than anything else, right?

P2: Exactly. And on top of that, my personal life has been... complicated lately.

P1: Complicated? What's going on? You can tell me.

P2: I don't know, it's just... I feel like I've been putting off some really important decisions, and it's weighing on me.

P1: Okay, well, maybe we can work through this together. I'm here for you, you know.
