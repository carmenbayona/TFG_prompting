P1: Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? I really need to cover my shift on Friday.

P2: Uh, yeah, what's going on? You're not thinking of bailing on me, are you?

P1: No, no, it's not that. I just got hit with a family emergency and I gotta take care of it. My grandma's in the hospital and I need to be there.

P2: Oh, man, sorry to hear that. What's going on with your grandma?

P1: She's not doing great, and I need to be there for my family. Can you cover my shift for me?

P2: Hmm, I don't know...I was really looking forward to that shift. But I guess I can do it. When do you need it covered?

P1: As soon as possible. I was thinking maybe you could take my shift and I can cover yours on Sunday?

P2: Yeah, that might work. But you owe me one, buddy.
