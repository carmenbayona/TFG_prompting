P1: Oh man, I just finished reading this amazing book, you have to check it out!

P2: Which one is it? I'm always looking for new recommendations.

P1: It's called "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo". Have you heard of it?

P2: Hmm, no... what's it about? Is it a romance?

P1: Yeah, it's a romance, but it's so much more than that. It's about this reclusive Hollywood star and her seven marriages.

P2: Whoa, that sounds juicy! Are there any, you know, shocking twists or spoilers?

P1: Oh, definitely! But that's what makes it so great. The author just does this amazing job of weaving these complex stories together.

P2: I don't know, man... I'm trying to avoid spoilers. Can you give me a hint without giving it away?

P1: Okay, okay! Let's just say that the main character's past is super complicated and there are some major revelations along the way.

P2: Alright, alright... I think I can handle that. So it's a historical fiction, right?

P1: Yeah, it's set in the 50s and 60s, but it's not strictly historical fiction. It's more like contemporary fiction that's just set in the past.

P2: Okay, cool. I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the rec!

P1: No problem, happy to share the love!
