P1: Oh my god, you won't believe the storm we just had last night! P2: What storm? What happened?

P1: I mean, the wind was howling like crazy and the rain was pouring down like there was no tomorrow! P2: That sounds intense. Was it a tornado or something?

P1: No, no, it was just a regular ol' thunderstorm, but it felt like the end of the world! P2: (laughs) You're such a drama queen! But seriously, was it really that bad?

P1: Yeah, seriously! I was up all night listening to the rain and thinking about all the times I've seen storms like that on the news. P2: Like what times?

P1: You know, like when that tornado ripped through Oklahoma a few years back... or that hurricane that hit Florida. P2: Yeah, those were crazy! I remember seeing that footage on TV.

P1: Right? It's like, you know the weather's getting more unpredictable and all that jazz. P2: That's what I've been wondering â€“ what's going on with the weather, you know? Is it really getting worse?

P1: Good question! I heard somewhere that it's because of global warming or something... P2: Hmm, that makes sense. I've been noticing how hot it's been this summer, too.
