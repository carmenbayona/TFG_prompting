P1: So, you won't believe what happened at the office today. I was walking in and I saw the CEO's coffee cup just sitting there on the table.

P2: What? That's crazy. What did you do?

P1: Well, I was about to pick it up and put it in the break room, but then I saw Karen walking in and I was like, "Oh no, she's gonna freak out."

P2: Karen's always been a bit of a coffee snob. Did she have a meltdown or something?

P1: Yeah, she totally lost it. Started yelling about how it's an "unacceptable breach of security" and stuff. I was like, "Girl, it's just a coffee cup."

P2: (laughs) Oh man, that's hilarious. Did anyone else see it happen?

P1: Yeah, a few people were walking by and they were all staring, like, "What's going on?" And I'm just standing there, holding the cup, thinking, "Should I just put it back?"

P2: (laughs) So, did you put it back or not?

P1: No, I ended up taking it to the break room and putting it in the "lost and found" bin. I mean, someone's gonna claim it eventually, right?

P2: (laughs) Yeah, probably. Well, that's definitely a story I'll be telling at the watercooler.
