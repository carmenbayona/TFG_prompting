P1: Hey, you won't believe what happened in the office today.

P2: What's going on? You're acting weird.

P1: Weird? It's just... well, I was on my way to grab lunch and I saw the CEO's assistant chasing after the mailroom guy with a stapler.

P2: Wait, what? Why was she chasing him?

P1: I have no idea, but apparently she was looking for some important package or something. And the mailroom guy was just running away, laughing his butt off.

P2: Hmm, that is weird. Did you see what was in the package?

P1: No, I didn't get a good look. But I was going to go ask her what it was all about... and then I saw the CEO walking out of the conference room, looking like she just saw a ghost.

P2: Whoa, that sounds intense. Do you think it's related to the big project deadline?

P1: I have no idea, but I'm definitely going to try to find out. Maybe we should go ask her what's going on.
