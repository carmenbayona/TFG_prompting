P1: Oh my gosh, I'm so stoked you're finally going to visit that new coffee shop downtown! I've been dying to go back and try their new pastry selection.

P2: Yeah, I've been hearing great things about it. What's the vibe like in there?

P1: It's super cozy, really intimate. The decor is really on point, too. And the baristas are so friendly and knowledgeable about their beans.

P2: Hmm, that sounds really cool. Are they open late at all?

P1: Yeah, they're open till 8 PM, which is perfect for us since we usually don't finish work till around 7.

P2: Awesome, so we can grab a cup of coffee and catch up after work. Do you think we should make a reservation or just walk in?

P1: Nah, I don't think reservations are necessary. It's not that popular yet, so we should be able to get a table easily.
