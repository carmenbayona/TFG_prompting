P1: Hey, have you been keeping up with the attendance in our psychology class?

P2: Uh, attendance? I think we've been having some issues with sign-in sheets being late or whatever.

P1: Yeah, I've noticed that too. I'm getting a little worried I might be missing some important stuff.

P2: Hmm, I don't know. I've been trying to keep track, but it's kinda hard with all the new material we're covering.

P1: Exactly! And I'm really struggling to keep up. Have you talked to the prof about it?

P2: Yeah, I sent her an email last week. She said she'd look into it, but I haven't heard back yet.

P1: That's frustrating. I might go talk to her myself. Do you think attendance is going to count towards our final grade?

P2: Honestly, I don't know. I'm trying to focus on the material more than the attendance, but it's still bothering me.
