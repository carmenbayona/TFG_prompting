P1: Oh my god, have you heard about the new book that just came out? It's getting so much buzz!

P2: No, what's it about? Is it a thriller?

P1: Yeah, it's a psychological thriller, but it's not just about the plot, it's about the writing style too. The author's really unique.

P2: Hmm, I love a good thrill. What's the writing style like? Is it dark and gritty?

P1: Yeah, it's got a really dark tone, but it's also really atmospheric. The author's got this way of describing settings that's just... wow.

P2: That sounds amazing. I'm definitely going to check it out. Is it a standalone or part of a series?

P1: It's a standalone, which is cool because it's a complete story, but it's also leaving me wanting more. I wish the author would write a sequel!

P2: Yeah, I agree. I always love when authors continue a story, but I also like when they wrap things up nicely like this one did.
