P1: Hey, have you heard what happened in the office today?

P2: No, what's going on? Something exciting, I hope?

P1: Haha, well, it was definitely eventful. So, Karen from HR spilled coffee all over the CEO's laptop.

P2: Oh no! What did she do?

P1: She tried to clean it with a napkin, which only made it worse. Then, she had a meltdown in the break room.

P2: Wow, that sounds like a real mess. What's the CEO saying about it?

P1: Apparently, he's been making fun of her on Slack, but in a nice way, you know? He's trying to make her feel better.

P2: That's actually pretty cool of him. I'm sure she's mortified, though.
