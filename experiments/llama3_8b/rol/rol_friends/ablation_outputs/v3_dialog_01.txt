Here is a generated dialog between friends planning a weekend trip:

---
P1: Dude, I'm so stoked to go on a weekend trip! You in?
P2: Hmm, I don't know... I've got a family commitment on Saturday.
P1: Ah, come on! It's gonna be a blast! We can hike and camp in the mountains. You can bring your fam along!
P2: I don't think that's gonna work. I already promised my niece I'd take her to the museum on Saturday.
P1: That's so cool! But we can easily reschedule, right? And think about it, you'll have some quality time with your niece and then we can hit the trails on Sunday.
P2: I'm not sure... (pauses) You know what? Forget it. We'll go another time.
P1: What's going on? You were totally on board a minute ago!
