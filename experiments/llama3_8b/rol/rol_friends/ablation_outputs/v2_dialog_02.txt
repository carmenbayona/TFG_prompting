P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked for the weekend! I was thinking of planning a trip to the beach.

P2: Hmm, I don't know, dude. I've got a family commitment on Saturday.

P1: Ah, come on! It's just one day, and we can leave early Sunday morning. We can watch the sunrise over the ocean!

P2: I don't know, man. I really should be there for my niece's birthday party. She's really looking forward to having me there.

P1: But think about it, we can make it a quick trip! We can leave right after breakfast, and be back by dinner. And we can always send a gift for your niece's party.

P2: (pauses) You know what, actually, I think I can make it work. As long as we leave really early and get back before the party starts.

P1: Yes! I knew you'd come around! I'll start packing tonight, and we can leave at 7 am on Sunday. It's going to be so much fun!
