P1: Oh man, have you seen the weather forecast for this weekend? Perfect trip weather! We should totally plan a quick getaway.

P2: Ugh, I don't know, dude. I have a family commitment on Saturday and Sunday. Can't we just stay in?

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be just a quick trip! We can leave Friday evening and come back Sunday night. It'll be a blast, I promise!

P2: I don't know...I need to check with my family about this commitment. What were you thinking of doing, anyway?

P1: Well, I was thinking we could hit up that new brewery in town, and then check out that new hiking trail that just opened up. And we can grab some dinner at that new BBQ joint.

P2: Hmm, that does sound kind of cool...but I still need to check with my family. Can you give me some more details on the itinerary?

P1: Sure thing! I was thinking we could leave around 5 pm on Friday, and then head to the brewery. We can grab dinner there, and then head to the hiking trail in the morning. We can make it a quick day trip, really.

P2: Okay, okay...I'll check with my family. But if they say no, I'm blaming you for ruining my weekend.
