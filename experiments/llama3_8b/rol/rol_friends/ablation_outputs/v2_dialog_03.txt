P1: Dude, we should totally go on a weekend trip! I've been planning this for weeks!

P2: Hmm, I don't know, man. I have a family commitment on Saturday.

P1: Ah, come on! It's just one day! We can make it work. And think about how fun it'll be! We can hike, and explore, and-

P2: Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before. But seriously, what's the plan? Where are we even going?

P1: Oh, right! I was thinking we could go to that new national park that just opened up. I heard it's amazing!

P2: (pauses) Wait, isn't that like, a five-hour drive?

P1: Uh, yeah... but it'll be worth it, trust me! And we can make a whole weekend out of it. We can even stop at some cool roadside attractions along the way.

P2: (sighs) I don't know, man. I really need to think about this. Can you send me the details and I'll get back to you?

P1: (excitedly) Awesome, I'll send you the whole itinerary right now! You won't regret it, I promise!
