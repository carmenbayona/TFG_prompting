---
P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked for this weekend trip! We're going to hit the beach and try out that new surf spot.  
P2: Yeah, yeah... I'll think about it. What's the plan again?  
P1: We'll leave Friday afternoon, grab some dinner, and then head to the coast. It'll be a blast!  
P2: I don't know... I have a family commitment on Saturday. Can't cancel on them.  
P1: Ah, come on! It's just one weekend. You can reschedule with them. It'll be a great chance to relax and unwind.  
P2: I don't know... I need more info. How long are we staying, and what's the plan for Sunday?  
P1: We'll stay until Sunday morning, then head back. And Sunday, we can explore that new town nearby. We can grab brunch and check out some shops. It'll be a great way to end the trip.  
P2: Okay, okay... I'll think about it. But if I don't like the surf spot, I'm blaming you!

In this dialog, P1 is excited to plan a weekend trip and tries to convince P2 to join, while P2 is skeptical and hesitant due to a family commitment. The subplot is that P2 has a commitment that P1 tries to convince them to reschedule. The imperfection is that P2 changes their mind mid-dialog, from being unwilling to consider the trip to eventually agreeing to think about it.
