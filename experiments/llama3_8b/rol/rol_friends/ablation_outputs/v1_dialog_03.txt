P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked for the weekend! I was thinking we could plan a quick trip to the beach.

P2: Ugh, I don't know, dude. I still have that family BBQ on Saturday.

P1: Ah, come on! It'll be a quick getaway. Just a night, two max. We can hit the beach, grab some dinner, and then head back.

P2: Hmm, I'm not sure... what's the plan? Are we driving or taking the train?

P1: Good question! I was thinking we could drive. It's only a few hours and we can stop at that new brewery on the way back.

P2: (pauses) Wait, I just remembered, the BBQ is actually on Sunday too. I could do Saturday instead.

P1: (laughs) Nice! Okay, deal! We'll go on Saturday. You can even bring your significant other if you want.

P2: (laughs) Yeah, sure. As long as we're not getting too crazy, I'm in. What time were you thinking of leaving?

P1: How about around 10 am? We can grab some breakfast on the way and hit the road.

P2: Sounds good to me. I'll make sure to pack my sunscreen.
