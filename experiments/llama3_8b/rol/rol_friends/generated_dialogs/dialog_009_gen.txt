P1: Dude, I'm still trying to figure out when we're leaving for the trip. Can you confirm we're still on for next Saturday?

P2: Yeah, what's wrong? You're acting all weird. We are going next Saturday, aren't we?

P1: Weird?! You're the one who's being weird! I thought we agreed to leave on Sunday, not Saturday.

P2: Sunday? No way, I specifically remember saying Saturday. Besides, your aunt said we had to be there by Saturday morning.

P1: That's exactly what I mean! Your aunt always gets us mixed up. We're going to be stuck in traffic on the highway, and then we'll miss the whole event.

P2: Oh, come on! It's not that bad. We'll just leave early and grab some breakfast on the go. It'll be fine.

P1: You're not listening to me. This is exactly what always happens when we travel with your aunt. She says one thing, and we end up doing another. I swear, if I have to deal with one more miscommunication...
