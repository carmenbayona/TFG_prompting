P1: Hey, I'm having trouble thinking of a birthday gift for Emma. She's into fantasy novels, but I'm not exactly sure what she'd like.

P2: Ah, yeah! I had the same problem. But I was thinking, maybe we could get her tickets to that new fantasy-themed concert coming up? Have you seen the lineup?

P1: Concert tickets? That's not a bad idea, but I just checked the schedule and they're actually playing on her birthday, which might be a bit of a challenge. How's her love life been lately?

P2: Oh, you know, same old drama. Anyway, if the concert thing doesn't work out, what about a gift related to her favorite books? Maybe something from that new bookstore downtown?

P1: Yeah, that's not a bad idea. But I was really hoping for something more... unique. You know, something that shows I actually care about her interests.

P2: Unique, huh? Well, have you thought about getting her a personalized bookmark or a set of exclusive booklight candles? Those might be a bit more thoughtful.
