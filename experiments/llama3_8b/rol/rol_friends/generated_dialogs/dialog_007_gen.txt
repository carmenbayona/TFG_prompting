P1: Dude, how's it going? I haven't seen you at the gym in ages!

P2: Ugh, I know, I know... I've just been so busy with work and stuff, I haven't had a chance to fit it in.

P1: Busy? You're always busy! Can't you just make time for a quick workout, man?

P2: I know, I know... I just feel so guilty when I'm not doing it regularly. And then I start making excuses... like, I had to work late last week, and then I had a family dinner on the weekend...

P1: Family dinner? You always make it sound like you're curing cancer or something! Come on, it's just a workout!
