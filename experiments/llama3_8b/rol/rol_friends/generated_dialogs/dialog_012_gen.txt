P1: Hey, have you thought about that Master's program in Data Science I mentioned the other day?

P2: Oh, yeah! I was really surprised you were even considering it. You know I'm always saying you're a whiz with numbers.

P1: Haha, thanks, man! But seriously, do you think it's worth the effort? I've been looking into it and it seems like a crazy competitive process.

P2: Ah, come on! You're gonna crush it! I've seen your projects, you're already doing advanced stuff. And think about how cool it'll be to expand your network in the field. Plus, I'll be right there with you, cheering you on!
