P1: Hey, man, I'm still waiting on you to book those train tickets. Can you please get on that already?

P2: Ah, sorry about that! I totally spaced out. What's the hold up?

P1: The hold up is that I was counting on you to book them and now I'm freaking out because we're running out of time! Next thing you know, they'll be sold out or something.

P2: Whoa, chill out! I didn't realize you were counting on me. I've been meaning to check on them, but with work and stuff, it slipped my mind.

P1: Yeah, yeah, I know it's not your fault, but can you please just book them already? I'm getting anxious just thinking about it.

P2: Okay, okay! I'll do it right now. But, hey, can I ask, why didn't you book them yourself? You're always saying how important planning is.

P1: Ugh, don't even get me started! My browser crashed, and I lost the whole booking page! I swear, technology hates me sometimes.

P2: Ah, sorry to hear that! But, hey, at least we're doing it now.
