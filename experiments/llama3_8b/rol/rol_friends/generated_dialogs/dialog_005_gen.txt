P1: Hey, what do you wanna do tonight?
P2: Hmm, I don't know, what were you thinking?
P1: Well, I was thinking we could watch a movie. I found this sick sci-fi film that just dropped on Netflix.
P2: Sci-fi, eh? Is it gonna be scary? I don't wanna have nightmares all night.
P1: Nah, it's not that bad. It's actually pretty chill. Besides, you can't let a little fear stop you from experiencing some awesome space battles.
P2: Alright, alright. You convinced me. What's the movie called, again?
P1: "Galactic Odyssey". You'll love it, I promise.
