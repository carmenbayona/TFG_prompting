P1: Oh man, we need to figure out our travel plans for the trip already! I don't want to leave it to the last minute.

P2: Ah, sorry about that, I got caught up in work and totally forgot. I promise I'll take care of it this week.

P1: Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before. You're always promising to get things done and then it slips your mind.

P2: Hey, I'm trying! And I did book the flights already, didn't I?

P1: Wait, what? You already got the flights? Why didn't you tell me?!

P2: Oh, I thought I sent you the confirmation email. Did you not get it?

P1: Yeah, I got it. But I thought we were supposed to book the hotel too. What's the plan for that?

P2: Right, sorry about that. I was going to take care of it this week. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
