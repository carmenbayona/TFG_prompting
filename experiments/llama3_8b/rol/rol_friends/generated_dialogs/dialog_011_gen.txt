P1: Dude, I'm freaking out! I can't find my charger anywhere.
P2: What's the big deal? You can just buy a new one.
P1: No way, I had that thing for years! And it's not just about the money, it's about the hassle of setting up my phone all over again.
P2: Okay, okay, I get it. So what's the plan? Are you trying to search the whole house or something?
P1: Yeah, I already looked everywhere. I even checked the couch cushions... again.
P2: You know, sometimes I think you're just pretending to forget things so you can spend more time watching Netflix.
P1: Hey, that's not true! I'm a very organized person, I swear.
P2: Yeah, sure, that's why you can't find your charger.
