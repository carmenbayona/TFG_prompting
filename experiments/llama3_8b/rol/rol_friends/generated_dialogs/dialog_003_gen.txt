P1: Ugh, I'm so frustrated with this laptop order. It's been three weeks and I still don't have it.

P2: Ah, sorry to hear that. What's going on?

P1: I ordered it online, and the tracking says it's been stuck in transit for weeks. I've called customer support three times and they just keep giving me the runaround.

P2: That's so annoying. Did you try contacting the company's social media team? Sometimes they're more helpful than the official support channels.

P1: Yeah, I did, and they just told me to call the main number again. I'm about to lose my mind over this.

P2: Okay, okay, let me try to help you out. Can you give me the order number?
