P1: Dude, are you free tonight? We're supposed to grab dinner before the meeting tomorrow.

P2: Yeah, what's up? Oh, the meeting... I totally spaced out.

P1: Haha, great, just what I need. You to show up late again. Remember how mad everyone got last time?

P2: Aw, come on! It was just traffic, and I'm not gonna be late, I swear. I'll leave plenty early to make sure.

P1: Okay, okay, I believe you this time. Just don't forget, it's at 2 PM, and we need to be there by 1:30.

P2: Got it, got it! I'll set multiple alarms, I promise. Sorry again, man, I'm really sorry.
