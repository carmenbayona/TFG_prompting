P1: Hey, have you been having any issues with your internet lately?
P2: Ugh, yeah. It's been slow as molasses. I've been trying to stream shows and it's always buffering.
P1: Yeah, I've been having some problems too. I thought it was just me, but I guess not.
P2: Yeah, I know. I've been checking the Wi-Fi signal strength and it's weak as heck. I'm starting to think it's our router or something. But I don't know what to do about it.
