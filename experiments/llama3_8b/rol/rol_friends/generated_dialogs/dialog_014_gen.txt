P1: Hey, what's going on? You've been stressed out lately, and I'm worried you're not getting enough sleep.

P2: Ugh, don't even get me started on my thesis. I'm stuck on this stupid methodology section, and I just can't seem to wrap my head around it.

P1: Ah, yeah, I remember those days. What's specifically giving you trouble? Is there a particular part that's got you stumped?

P2: Yeah, it's just...I feel like I've been staring at these graphs for weeks, and I still don't get what they're trying to tell me. And the literature review is just too overwhelming.

P1: Okay, okay, let's break it down. Can I take a look at your research proposal? Maybe we can walk through it together and figure out what's throwing you off.

P2: Yeah, sure thing. But, honestly, I don't know if it'll help. I feel like I've already tried everything, and I'm just going crazy.

P1: Hey, you're not going crazy! We'll get through this together. And hey, speaking of crazy, remember that time we stayed up all night trying to finish that project?

P2: Ugh, don't remind me!
