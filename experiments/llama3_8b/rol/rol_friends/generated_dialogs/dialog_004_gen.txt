P1: Hey, I finally finished that thesis draft, but I'm freaking out a bit. Want to take a look and give me some feedback?

P2: Ah, yeah, sure thing! I was just about to start reading it. So, what's got you freaking out?

P1: I don't know, man, it just feels like it's not good enough. I'm worried I'm gonna fail or something.

P2: Relax, you're gonna be fine. But, honestly, it's not the strongest draft. Your literature review is solid, but the rest could use some work.

P1: Yeah, I knew that part was a bit rough. But what's with the rest? Is it just me being paranoid?

P2: Well, some of the sentences are a bit repetitive, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. But, you know, it's not like it's a total disaster.

P1: Okay, okay, I guess I can work on that. But what do you think of the actual content? Is it like, worth reading or something?
