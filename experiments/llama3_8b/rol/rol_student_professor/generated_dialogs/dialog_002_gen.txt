P1: I'm having the worst time booking my travel arrangements for the conference. I've been trying to get it sorted out for weeks, and I still can't seem to get it right.

P2: Sorry to hear that. What's the issue you're experiencing? Is it with the airline, hotel, or something else?

P1: I'm not sure, to be honest. I thought I had everything booked, but then I got an email saying that my flight was cancelled, and I have no idea what's going on.

P2: Okay, let's take a step back. Can you show me the email you received? That might help us figure out what's going on.

P1: (pauses) Um, I think I left it on my computer. I'll check it out and bring it to you. (pauses again) Wait, which computer was it again? Was it my laptop or desktop?

P2: That's alright, don't worry about it. Just bring whatever you have, and we'll take a look together.

P1: Okay, I'll go grab it. But I'm really frustrated with this. Can't anyone at the conference help me out?

P2: Of course, we'll do our best to assist you. I'll even call the airline and check on the status of your flight myself, just to make sure everything gets sorted out.
