P1: Hi Professor, I'm having some trouble with my thesis methodology. I've been trying to decide on a research design, but I'm just not sure what's best for my study.

P2: Ah, okay, let's take a look at what you have so far. (pauses) Okay, so you're having trouble with research design... Can you tell me a bit more about what you're trying to achieve with your study?

P1: Yeah, I'm trying to investigate the impact of social media on mental health in young adults. But I'm not sure if I should do a survey or an experiment. And I've been reading a lot of different articles on this topic, but it's all feeling really overwhelming.

P2: Okay, I see. It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. (sighs) Look, I've been there too, and it's frustrating when it feels like everything is unclear. Can I ask, what specifically is it about surveys and experiments that's making you hesitant? Are you worried about sample size or something else?

P1: Yeah, sample size is definitely a concern. But also, I'm not sure how to decide between the two. I feel like both have their pros and cons, and I'm not sure which one would be more effective for my study.

P2: Okay, got it. So we're looking at sample size and effectiveness. Alright, let me see if I can help you break it down. (pauses) Okay, so have you considered using a mixed-methods approach? That could give you some flexibility in terms of data collection and analysis.

P1: That's a great idea. I hadn't thought of that. Can you explain more about how that would work?

P2: Absolutely. I can give you a quick overview of the pros and cons of mixed-methods, and we can discuss how it might apply to your study.
