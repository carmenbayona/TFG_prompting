P1: Hi, teacher, I'm having some issues with my family's house. We've had some problems with the plumbing lately.

P2: What kind of problems? Is it just leaks or is it something more serious?

P1: Well, the sink's been kind of wonky for a while now, and yesterday, the toilet overflowed. We're pretty worried about it.

P2: Hmm, that does sound concerning. Have you guys tried to, uh, fix it yourself?

P1: We tried to fix the sink, but it just kept overflowing. And, to be honest, my mom's been nagging me about fixing the toilet for weeks now. But I'm not really sure what I'm doing.

P2: Okay, well, let's take a step back. Can you tell me more about the previous repair you did on the sink? What exactly did you do?

P1: Uh, I think we just tightened some pipes or something? My dad said it would be easy, but... I don't know if it was done right.

P2: Alright, I think I have a good idea of what's going on. I'll schedule a maintenance check for your house and see if we can resolve these issues.
