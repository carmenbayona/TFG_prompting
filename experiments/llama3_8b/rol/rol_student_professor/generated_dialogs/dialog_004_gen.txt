P1: Hi, Professor Thompson, I'm excited to get your feedback on my thesis draft.

P2: Ah, good afternoon! I've taken a look at your draft, and I think we can definitely work with it. What are your thoughts on the literature review?

P1: Honestly, I was hoping to delve deeper into the topic. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

P2: I see what you mean. One area where I think you could improve is by incorporating more recent sources. You're relying a bit too heavily on older research.

P1: That's a good point. I didn't realize I was doing that. Can you give me some specific examples of where I could incorporate more contemporary studies?

P2: Well, for instance, your discussion of the Johnson study could be expanded to include the more recent findings in the Smith et al. paper. Additionally, you might consider addressing some of the limitations in the existing literature.

P1: Okay, I think I understand. So, it's not just about adding more sources, but also about showing how they build on or challenge each other?

P2: Exactly! That's a great way to think about it. Now, let's talk about some specific sections where you could expand on your ideas.
