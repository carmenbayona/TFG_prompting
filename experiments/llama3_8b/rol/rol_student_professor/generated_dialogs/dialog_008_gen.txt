P1: Hey, Mrs. Johnson, I need some help finding a birthday gift for Emma. She's really into music and books, but I'm not sure what to get.

P2: Ah, that's a tough one! What's the occasion, is it her birthday or just a random celebration?

P1: Yeah, it's her birthday. She's turning 18, and I want to get her something special.

P2: Okay, so music and books, huh? Have you considered getting her a concert ticket to her favorite artist's show?

P1: That's a great idea! But I'm not sure which artist she likes the most. Can you help me narrow it down?

P2: Yeah, sure thing! Can you tell me a bit more about her music taste? Does she like classic rock, pop, hip-hop, or something else?
