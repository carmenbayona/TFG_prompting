Here is a formal, grammatically correct conversation between a student and a professor:

P1: Professor, I was wondering if I could discuss my current project deadline with you. I've been experiencing some personal issues that have hindered my progress.

P2: Yes, of course. What kind of personal issues are you referring to?

P1: Well, I've recently experienced a family emergency and I've had to attend to some matters. I'm finding it difficult to meet the original deadline.

P2: I see. Can you tell me specifically what the original deadline is and what you have accomplished so far?

P1: The original deadline is next Friday, and I've completed about 70% of the project, but I'm struggling to finish the remaining 30%.

P2: I understand the situation, but I must stress that the deadline has been set to ensure timely completion of the course. Can you provide a revised deadline you think you can meet?

P1: I was thinking of extending it by a week, to the following Friday. I'm confident that I can complete the project on time by then.

P2: Alright, I can consider extending the deadline. However, I need to review your plan and ensure that it meets the course requirements. I'll get back to you by the end of the week with a decision.
