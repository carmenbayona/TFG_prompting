P1: Professor, I would like to discuss the deadline for the upcoming project. I've been experiencing some personal difficulties lately, and I'm finding it challenging to meet the original deadline.

P2: I see. Personal difficulties can be unpredictable and challenging to manage. Can you tell me more about what's been going on and how it's affecting your work on the project?

P1: Yes, unfortunately, I've been dealing with a family issue that requires my attention. I've been trying to juggle my responsibilities, but it's taking a toll on my productivity.

P2: I understand the importance of family and the need to prioritize responsibility. However, extensions are not typically granted without a clear plan for completing the work. Can you propose a revised timeline for completing the project?

P1: Ah, yes... um... I was thinking perhaps an additional two weeks would be sufficient to get everything done... I've already completed some of the work, and I'm confident I can finish the rest... (stutter)

P2: Two weeks is a significant extension, and I need to consider the impact on the rest of the class. Can you provide me with a detailed plan, including specific tasks and milestones, for completing the project within the revised timeframe?

P1: Yes, of course... I'll prepare a detailed plan and submit it to you by the end of the week. I assure you, I'll put in the extra effort to ensure the work is completed to the best of my abilities.

P2: Very well. I will review your plan and get back to you by the following week. Keep in mind that I will need to approve the revised deadline before it is officially extended.
