P1: E-e-excuse me, Professor Johnson, I-I-I was w-w-wondering if I could s-s-speak with you about the deadline for my upcoming project.

P2: Ah, yes, what's going on, student? You're usually on top of your work.

P1: Y-y-yes, I am, but r-r-recently I've been having some p-p-personal issues that are making it h-h-hard for me to keep up with my coursework.

P2: I see. Personal issues can be challenging. But let me clarify, you're asking for an extension on the project deadline?
