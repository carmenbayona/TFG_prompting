P1: O-oh, p-professor j-jones, I-I was w-wondering if I c-could s-see you for a m-moment.

P2: Of course, student. What's on your mind?

P1: I-I was trying to finish this project, but, um, some personal issues have been, uh, affecting my, ah, focus. And I-I was w-wondering if it would be possible to, um, get an extension on the deadline.

P2: I see. And what kind of personal issues are we talking about?

P2: Also, can you clarify what you mean by "personal issues"? Is it related to your academic performance or is it something else entirely?

P1: S-sorry, p-professor. I-I didn't m-mean to be vague. It's just that, um, my family is going through a bit of a rough patch right now, and I've been, uh, trying to help out as much as I can. And, ah, it's been making it a bit tough to keep up with my coursework.

P2: I understand that family difficulties can be a significant burden. However, as your professor, it's my responsibility to ensure that you're meeting the academic standards of this course. Can you tell me what you've accomplished so far and what you still need to complete to meet the original deadline?
