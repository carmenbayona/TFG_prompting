P1: D-do you have a minute to talk about the p-project deadline? I'm having some t-trouble with it.
P2: What seems to be the issue?
P1: I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I've been dealing with some personal stuff and it's been affecting my focus.
P2: I see. Can you clarify what's been going on that's causing you stress?
P1: Y-yeah... my grandmother's been ill and I've had to take some time off to take care of her. It's been a big adjustment.
P2: I'm sorry to hear that. However, as you know, the deadline is non-negotiable. Can you describe the scope of work you've completed so far?
P1: I-I have most of the research done, but I'm struggling to analyze the data and write up my findings. I think I need more time to get it right.
P2: Okay, let me think about it. Can you tell me more about what you've done so far and what you still need to complete?
P1: Y-yeah, I'll send you an update and we can discuss it further.
P2: Alright, I'll review it and get back to you.
