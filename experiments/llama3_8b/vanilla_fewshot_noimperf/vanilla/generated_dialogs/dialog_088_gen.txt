P1: Look, I'm tired of hearing politicians promise the world and not delivering. We need real change, not just empty rhetoric.

P2: I see what you mean, but don't you think we're being a bit harsh on them? I mean, they're trying to make a difference, right?

P1: Trying to make a difference? Ha! They're just trying to get re-elected. I've seen the same promises being made for years, and nothing changes. We need someone who's willing to shake things up.

P2: That's a good point... but how do we know who that someone is? We can't just throw out the entire political system because we're not seeing the changes we want immediately.

P1: (pausing) Well... that's a good question. I guess I'm just frustrated because I feel like our voices aren't being heard. We need someone who's willing to listen to the people, not just their special interest donors.

P2: I see what you're saying. So, you think we need a more grassroots approach? Maybe someone who's not beholden to any particular party or ideology?

P1: Exactly! We need someone who's willing to put the people's interests ahead of their own. And I think we're starting to see that with some of the newer, independent candidates who are rising up.
