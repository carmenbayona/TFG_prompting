P1: Hey, did you catch the game last night? The Celtics were on fire!

P2: Ah, no, I was stuck in a meeting. How did they do?

P1: Oh, they crushed it! They won by 15 points. But, you know, the real story was Kyrie's performance... (pauses) ...what a game! I mean, he scored 35 points and had 7 assists. Just incredible.

P2: Wow, that does sound amazing. I'm a big fan of his. What was his shooting percentage like?

P1: (hesitates) Uh, let me check... (pauses again) Ah, yeah, he was a scorching 50% from the field. And get this, he made 5 three-pointers. I mean, the guy's a wizard!

P2: That's insane. Did you notice the crowd's reaction when he hit that game-winning shot?

P1: (repeats) Oh, yeah, the crowd went wild! They were cheering for like 5 minutes straight. It was so loud, I had to yell to be heard. (chuckles) Good times.

P2: (laughs) That sounds like a blast. I'm definitely going to have to watch the replay of that game.
