P1: Hey, have you thought about our travel plans for the summer? We've been putting it off for too long.

P2: Oh yeah, I've been thinking about it, but I'm not sure what to do. I've always wanted to visit Japan, but it's so expensive. And we've never been on a trip together without the family.

P1: That's true. Okay, so let's break it down. Japan might be a bit pricey, but we could look into budget-friendly options. And I think it would be really cool to experience the culture together, just the two of us.

P2: Hmm, that's a good point. I did find a great deal on flights to Tokyo, but it's still a big expense. What do you think about looking into other destinations? Maybe somewhere in Europe?

P1: Europe's always a great idea... (pauses) Okay, let me think. We could consider Italy, Croatia... or even Iceland! I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights.

P2: Whoa, Iceland sounds amazing! I've never been, but I've heard it's breathtakingly beautiful. But, I mean, wouldn't it be really cold? And won't it be expensive?

P1: Yeah, it would be chilly, but we could always pack warm clothes. And as for the cost, I think it's worth it. We could look into budget-friendly accommodations and activities. And just think about all the stunning landscapes we could see!

P2: Okay, okay... you're making me excited! (laughs) I think we should start looking into it. But what about the Northern Lights? Is that really a guarantee?

P1: Not exactly, but we could take a guided tour that increases our chances of seeing them. And even if we don't, the scenery's still going to be incredible. How's that sound?
