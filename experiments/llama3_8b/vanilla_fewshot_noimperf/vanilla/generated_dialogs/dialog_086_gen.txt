P1: Excuse me, do you know the way to the city center from here?

P2: Ah, yeah! I think so. Let me just... (pauses) Okay, if you head down this street, take a left at the next light, and then straight for a few blocks, you'll hit Main Street. Can't miss it.

P1: That sounds right. But what about the park? I was thinking of going for a walk there. Is it nearby?

P2: (laughs) Yeah, you're really close! The park is actually just a block away from Main Street. You can't miss it, either. There's a big fountain in the middle. (pauses) Unless... unless you mean the botanical gardens. Those are a bit farther, but still pretty close.

P1: Oh, the botanical gardens. Yeah, that's what I meant. I've never been, so I'm not really sure what to expect.

P2: (hesitates) Well, it's really beautiful this time of year. They have all these rare plants and flowers. (pauses again) But if you're not into that sort of thing, there's also a nice little caf√© near the entrance. You could grab a coffee and people-watch.

P1: Sounds like a plan! Thanks for the directions. I think I'll head there now.

P2: No problem! Have fun, and enjoy the gardens!
