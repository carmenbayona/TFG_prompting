P1: Hey, have you seen that new Marvel movie, Avengers: Endgame? I just got back from the cinema and I'm still reeling from the experience.

P2: No, I haven't had a chance to see it yet. What was it about? Is it as good as everyone says?

P1: *pauses* Okay, so... without giving away too many spoilers... the movie is a culmination of 22 movies, and it's literally a game-changer. The way they tie up loose ends and bring everything full circle is just... wow.

P2: That sounds incredible. I've been waiting for this movie for years. What did you think of the characters? Were they well-developed?

P1: Definitely. I think the Russo brothers did an amazing job of balancing the entire cast. You get to see some of your favorite characters get the spotlight, and it's really emotional at times. *pauses* But, I do have to say, some of the plot twists were a bit... confusing. I had to rewind the movie a few times to make sure I understood what was happening.

P2: Confusing? That's not what I've heard so far. But hey, I love a good mystery. Did you like the new characters they introduced?

P1: Yeah, I thought the new characters were great. The way they wove them into the story was seamless. And the visuals? Oh man, the visuals are stunning. You have to see it on the big screen to appreciate it.

P2: Alright, you're sold. I'll have to make sure to catch it in theaters. Thanks for the info, P1!
