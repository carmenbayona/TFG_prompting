P1: So, we're doing a group project for this marketing class, right? We need to come up with a strategy for promoting a new product launch.

P2: Yeah, I remember the professor mentioning that. What kind of strategy are you thinking of?

P1: Well, I was thinking we could do a social media campaign. We could create a buzz around the product by posting engaging content, running ads, and encouraging users to share their experiences with the hashtag.

P2: That sounds interesting. How would we measure the effectiveness of the campaign?

P1: Ah, good question... (pauses) Let me think... We could set up Google Analytics to track the website traffic and conversions, and use social media metrics like engagement rates and impression numbers to gauge the campaign's success.

P2: I see. And what's the timeline looking like for this project?

P1: We need to have a proposal ready by the end of the week, and then we'll be presenting it to the class. After that, we'll have about three weeks to execute the plan.

P2: Okay, got it. So, what's the budget looking like for this campaign? Can we afford to run ads and hire influencers?

P1: Good point... (hesitates) Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. I was thinking we could try to get some pro-bono work from a local design firm, and then see if we can get some sponsorships to offset the costs.

P2: That's a great idea! And what about our team's roles? Who's going to handle what responsibilities?

P1: Well, I was thinking we could divide the tasks based on our strengths. We could have you handle the social media side of things, and I'll take care of the content creation and analytics.

P2: Sounds like a plan! But, just to confirm, what's the product we're promoting again?

P1: (laughs) Ah, good memory! We're promoting a new line of eco-friendly cleaning products.
