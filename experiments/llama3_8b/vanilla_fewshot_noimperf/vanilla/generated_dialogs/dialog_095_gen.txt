P1: Oh my god, I have the most amazing surprise planned for you for your birthday! I've been working on it for weeks!

P2: Hmm, you're really secretive about it. What's going on? Is it something I'll like?

P1: Of course, you'll love it! I just need to make sure everything is perfect before I reveal it. So, have you given any thought to what you want to do for your birthday this year?

P2: Honestly, I haven't really thought about it. I've been too caught up in work to plan anything. But I'm excited to hear your surprise idea!

P1: Yeah, I know. I've been doing some research and I think I've found the perfect activity. But before I tell you, can I ask, have you ever gone skydiving?

P2: No, I've never gone skydiving. Is that what you're going to do for my birthday?

P1: Well, it's not exactly that... but it's in a similar vein. Trust me, you'll love it! And I think it'll be a great experience for you. So, are you ready to hear the surprise?
