P1: So, you're looking to order at that new Italian place downtown, huh? I've heard great things about it. Their pasta dishes are supposed to be amazing.

P2: Oh, yeah! I've been wanting to try it out. What's the menu like? Do they have any specials or anything?

P1: Yeah, they have a daily special board, which changes depending on what's fresh and seasonal. And, um, let me see if I can remember what I ordered last time... (pauses) Ah, yes! I got the lasagna Bolognese, and it was incredible.

P2: Mmm, that sounds good. I love lasagna. So, how much did it cost? Was it expensive?

P1: Oh, no, not at all. It was around $18, I think. And they have a great wine list too, if you're interested in pairing a bottle with your meal. (pauses) Wait, what was the question again? (laughs)

P2: (laughs) No worries! So, what's the atmosphere like in there? Is it cozy and intimate or more lively and loud?

P1: Yeah, it's a medium-sized place, so it's not too loud or too quiet. The decor is really nice too â€“ it's got that classic Italian feel, you know? And the staff is always friendly and attentive.
