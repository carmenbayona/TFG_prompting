P1: OMG, I'm so excited to tell you about the surprise I have planned for your birthday! I've been working on it for weeks, and it's going to be epic!

P2: Haha, what is it? You're being really vague, and I'm dying to know!

P1: Okay, okay! I'll give you a hint. It involves a road trip to your favorite city, and a special activity that you've always wanted to try. But that's all I'm saying for now!

P2: Whoa, that sounds amazing! But how did you manage to plan all of this without me finding out? You're usually really bad at keeping secrets!

P1: Ah, that's the best part! I had to get creative and enlist the help of a few trusted friends. And also, I used my mastery of Google Calendar to my advantage. Shh, don't tell anyone!

P2: That's so sneaky! But I love it! When are we leaving? And what's this special activity you mentioned?

P1: We're leaving on Saturday morning, and I'll reveal the activity when we get to the destination. Just trust me, it'll be worth the suspense!
