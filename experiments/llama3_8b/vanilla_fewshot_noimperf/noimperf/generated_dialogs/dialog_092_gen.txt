P1: Hey, Emily. I need to talk to you about next Friday. I'm going to be taking a personal day to attend to some family stuff.

P2: Oh, okay! What's going on? Is everything all right?

P1: Yeah, everything's fine. It's just my mom's birthday and I promised her I'd be there. We're going to have a little celebration and I won't be able to come into work.

P2: Aw, happy birthday to your mom! I didn't know it was her birthday. What's the plan? You're not going to be doing anything super exciting, are you?

P1: Ha! Well, let's just say we're going to have a low-key dinner and maybe watch a movie together. Nothing too crazy. I'll make sure all my tasks are caught up before I leave, so you don't have to worry about covering anything.

P2: That sounds nice. I'm sure your mom will appreciate it. Do you have any fun plans beyond the celebration?

P1: Actually, we're going to visit my grandma who recently moved into a new assisted living facility. It'll be good to catch up with her and see how she's adjusting.

P2: That's really thoughtful of you. I'm sure your grandma will love seeing you.
