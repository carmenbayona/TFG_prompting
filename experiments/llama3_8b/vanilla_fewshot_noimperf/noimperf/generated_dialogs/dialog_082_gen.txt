P1: Hey, have you tried that new Italian place down the street? I've been wanting to check it out.

P2: No, I haven't! What's it like? Is their pasta good?

P1: Yeah, I've heard great things. I've been meaning to try their lasagna. Do you want to go with me this weekend?

P2: That sounds like a lot of fun! But what's the deal with ordering at restaurants? I always feel like I'm doing it wrong. Do you have any tips?

P1: Actually, I've been reading up on the psychology of menu design, and it's really interesting. Apparently, restaurants use certain techniques to influence our ordering decisions. Like, did you know that menus with a lot of options can actually make it harder for you to decide?

P2: Whoa, that's crazy! I had no idea. So, what's the best way to order then?

P1: Well, one trick is to narrow down your options by choosing a specific type of cuisine or dish. And don't be afraid to ask for recommendations â€“ the servers are there to help, and they often know the most popular or unique items on the menu.
