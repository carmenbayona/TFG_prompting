P1: Excuse me, can you help me with directions? I'm trying to get to the city center, but I'm not familiar with the area.

P2: Ah, yeah! I've lived around here for a while. What's your current location? Are you coming from the north or south?

P1: I'm actually coming from the east side of town. I just got off the bus and I'm not sure which way to go.

P2: Okay, so you're pretty close. There's a big intersection up ahead, and you can't miss it. If you head towards the bright blue building, you'll hit the main street. From there, it's a straight shot to the city center.

P1: That sounds easy enough. But what if I take a wrong turn? How do I know if I'm heading in the right direction?

P2: Ah, great question! So, a good trick is to keep an eye out for landmarks. There's a big clock tower on the main street that's hard to miss. If you see that, you know you're on the right track. And if you do happen to take a wrong turn, don't worry – it's an easy fix. Just ask someone for directions!

P1: That's really helpful, thanks! I feel a lot more confident now. Oh, and can I ask one more thing – is there a good place to grab lunch around here?

P2: Absolutely! There's a fantastic sandwich shop just a block away from the main street. They're known for their delicious subs and welcoming atmosphere. You can't miss it – just look for the bright red awning.
