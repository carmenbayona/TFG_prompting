P1: Hey, Sarah! I was thinking of heading out to the mountains this weekend for some hiking. I heard the trails are really beautiful this time of year.

P2: Ooh, that sounds amazing! I've been wanting to get out of the city for a bit. What part of the mountains are you thinking of going to?

P1: I was thinking of heading to Rocky Mountain National Park. I've been there before, but it's always worth another visit. The aspen trees are supposed to be especially stunning this time of year.

P2: I've never been there, but I've heard great things. What's the plan for the day? Are you going to tackle one of the bigger peaks or stick to some of the easier trails?

P1: Actually, I was thinking of doing a combination of both. We can do a shorter hike to a scenic overlook in the morning, and then tackle one of the bigger peaks later in the day if we're feeling up for it.

P2: That sounds like a great plan! What's the hardest part of the hike, do you think? And are you planning on camping overnight or just doing a day trip?
