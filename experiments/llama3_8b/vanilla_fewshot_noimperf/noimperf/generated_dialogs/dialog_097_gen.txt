P1: Hey, have you had a chance to think about our group project yet? I was thinking we could do a presentation on the impact of climate change on local businesses.

P2: Yeah, I've been giving it some thought! I was thinking we could focus on the effect of climate change on the local agriculture industry. What do you think?

P1: That's a great idea! I was worried it might be too broad, but narrowing it down to agriculture will give us a chance to really dig in. What specific aspects of agriculture were you thinking of exploring?

P2: Well, I was thinking we could look at the impact on crop yields, water usage, and maybe even the economics of it all. Have you given any thought to possible data sources we could use?

P1: Yeah, I was thinking we could use some of the data from the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. And I found this one study that looked at the effect of climate change on coffee yields in Latin America – it was really interesting.

P2: Whoa, that sounds like some cool data! And it's a great example of how climate change can have a ripple effect on entire industries. What do you think about doing a case study on a local farm or business that's been affected?

P1: That's a fantastic idea! I know this one local farm that's been struggling with drought and soil erosion – it would be a great way to make the topic more relatable. Plus, we could get some primary data from the farm owners themselves.

P2: That sounds like a great plan! I'll start researching the USDA data and see what else I can find. You start looking into that farm and let's meet up soon to discuss our plan.
