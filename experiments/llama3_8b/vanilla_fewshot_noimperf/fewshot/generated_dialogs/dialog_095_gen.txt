P1: So, I was thinking of surprising my sister for her birthday. She loves that new coffee shop downtown, so I was thinking of taking her there for breakfast.
P2: That sounds like a great idea! What's the special occasion?
P1: Her 25th birthday. I wanted to do something special, but I haven't decided yet. I was thinking of maybe getting her a small gift...
P2: Oh, yeah? What kind of gift were you thinking of?
P1: Hmm... I was thinking maybe a nice candle or some jewelry... I'm not really sure, though. I don't want to get her something she doesn't like.
P2: Yeah, that can be tough. Have you thought about experiences instead of gifts? Sometimes those can be really memorable.
P1: Oh, yeah... that's a great idea! I could take her to that concert she's been wanting to go to... or maybe that new art museum exhibit...
P2: That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you think she'd like that?
P1: Yeah, I think so... but I'm still not sure. I don't want to commit to something and then realize it's not her thing.
P2: I understand. Why don't you just ask her what she wants to do? That way you'll know for sure.
P1: Yeah, that's a good idea... I just didn't want to ruin the surprise.
