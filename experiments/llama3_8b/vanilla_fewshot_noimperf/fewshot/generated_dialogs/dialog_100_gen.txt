P1: So, have you checked the weather forecast for the week?
P2: Honestly, not yet. I was thinking of doing it later today.
P1: Yeah, it's been pretty unpredictable lately. I checked it this morning, and it says there's a chance of scattered thunderstorms tomorrow.
P2: That's a bit of a bummer. I was hoping to get some outdoor work done.
P1: Yeah, it's always frustrating when the weather doesn't cooperate. And I've noticed that the humidity has been really high too.
P2: That's exactly what I've been feeling! My skin has been breaking out like crazy. Do you think it's just the weather or something else?
P1: I'm not sure, but maybe it's a combination of both? The heat and humidity can definitely exacerbate skin issues. You should probably look into some air conditioning or fans if you don't have them already.
P2: Good idea. I'll have to look into that. Thanks for letting me know about the weather!
