P1: So, we need to get started on this group project. We have to present our findings in three weeks.
P2: Okay, I've never done a group project before. What are the expectations?
P1: Well, usually, we divide the work among team members. We'll need to decide on a topic, gather data, and create a presentation.
P2: That sounds like a lot. What's the topic supposed to be about?
P1: Honestly, it's open-ended. We have to choose something related to our field of study. (pauses) Oh, and I almost forgot. We also need to submit a proposal by next Thursday.
P2: A proposal? That's a lot of work already. Can you tell me more about what's required?
P1: Yeah, of course. It's just a brief overview of our idea, including the goals, methodology, and expected outcomes. (repeats) And it's due next Thursday.
P2: Got it. Okay, I think I understand what's expected. What's the plan for dividing the work?
P1: Well, we should discuss that as a team. We could assign tasks based on people's strengths and interests. What do you think?
P2: That sounds like a good idea. But what if we encounter any issues or disagreements?
P1: Good questions. We should also establish a communication plan and set regular check-ins to ensure everyone's on the same page.
P2: Alright, I think I'm starting to get a better idea of what's involved. Thanks for filling me in.
