P1: So, I've been thinking of heading to the mountains for the weekend. I've heard the fall foliage is amazing this time of year.
P2: Oh, really? I've been meaning to get out of the city too. What's the plan?
P1: Well, I was thinking of hiking the Highline Trail. I've heard it's pretty strenuous, but the views are supposed to be incredible.
P2: Wow, that sounds intense. Are you planning on camping or staying in a lodge?
P1: Uh, I hadn't thought that far ahead. I guess I'll have to look into that. Do you have any experience with... (pauses) ...backpacking?
P2: Yeah, I went on a trip with friends a few years ago. We did a bunch of day hikes, but nothing too crazy like the Highline Trail. What made you choose that specific trail?
P1: I guess I just wanted to challenge myself a bit. And I've heard the trail is really well-marked, so I'm not too concerned about getting lost. (pauses again) Oh, and I almost forgot to mention â€“ I was considering bringing my friend's dog along. She's really well-behaved, but I'm not sure if that's allowed on the trail.
P2: That's a great idea! I'm sure the dog would love it. Do you think it would be okay to bring her, or should we check with park rangers first?
