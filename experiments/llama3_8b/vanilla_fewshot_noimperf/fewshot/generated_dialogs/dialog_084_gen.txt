P1: Have you seen any good movies lately?
P2: Yeah, I just watched that new sci-fi film. I really loved it! It had a great plot twist.
P1: That sounds interesting! What's it about?
P2: It's about a team of astronauts who discover a mysterious alien artifact. But then, they start to question whose side it's on.
P1: Wow, that sounds really cool. I've been wanting to see it. What made it stand out to you?
P2: Well, the special effects were amazing. And the acting was really strong. The main character was so... conflicted.
P1: Hmm, I see what you mean. I might have to check it out. Did you like the ending?
P2: Yeah, I did! But, I have to admit, I was a bit confused by some of the details. So, I had to watch it again to understand it better.
