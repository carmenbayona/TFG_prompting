P1: So, we're planning the trip to Paris for the conference in June, correct?

P2: That's right, Johnson. I've already booked our flights and hotel.

P1: Wait, you've booked the hotel? I thought we were supposed to wait for the conference organizers to confirm the accommodations.

P2: (hesitation) Ah, yes... I may have gotten a bit ahead of myself. But I assure you, the hotel is close to the convention center and has excellent reviews.

P1: I see. Well, I'd like to reviews the confirmation myself. Can you forward me the booking details?

P2: Of course, Johnson. I'll send them over right away.
