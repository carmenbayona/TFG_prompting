P1: Hi, I'm looking for some gift ideas for Emma's birthday. Do you have any suggestions?
P2: Ah, sure thing! What's Emma interested in?
P1: Well, she loves to read, but I'm not sure what kind of books she'd like. Can you think of something?
P2: (pause) Hmm... I'm not sure either, but I know she's into fantasy novels. Maybe something by George R.R. Martin?
P1: That's a great idea! I'll look into that. What about something more experiential, like a concert ticket?
P2: That's a fantastic idea! Have you thought about who she'd like to see live?
