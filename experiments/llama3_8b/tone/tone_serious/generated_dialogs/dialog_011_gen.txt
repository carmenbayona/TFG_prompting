P1: Hi, I'm having trouble finding my phone charger. I was wondering if you could help me locate it.

P2: Of course, I'd be happy to help. When was the last time you saw it?

P1: Hmm, I think it was when I was watching TV in the living room last night. But I also checked my bag and it's not there.

P2: Okay, let's start by searching the living room. Can you show me where exactly you think you left it?
