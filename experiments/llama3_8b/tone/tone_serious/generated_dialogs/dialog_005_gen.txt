P1: Hi, I was thinking it's been a while since we had a movie night. What do you think?

P2: Ah, yeah, I'd love to have one soon. What kind of movie were you thinking of?

P1: Well, I was thinking of something sci-fi. Have you seen that new alien invasion movie?

P2: (hesitation) Uh, I think I've seen the trailer, but I'm not sure if it's my cup of tea. Can you tell me more about it?

P1: Yeah, sure thing. It's got great reviews and it's not too long. I think we could both enjoy it.

P2: Alright, that sounds good. And what about snacks? Do you have any preferences or should I take care of that?

P1: Actually, I was thinking we could do some popcorn and maybe some chocolate chip cookies. Sound good to you?
