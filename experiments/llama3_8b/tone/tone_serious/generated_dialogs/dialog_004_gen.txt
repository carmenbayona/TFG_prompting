P1: I'd appreciate your feedback on my thesis draft. Could you start by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses you've identified?

P2: Well, I think your arguments are well-structured, but I'm concerned about the literature review section. It seems a bit disjointed and could be tightened up.

P1: That's a great point. I did struggle with how to integrate the literature review. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "disjointed"?

P2: Sure. It appears you've included some relevant studies, but they're not fully connected to each other. You might consider grouping them by theme or theory.

P1: I see what you mean. I was trying to cover a wide range of topics. But I sense there might be some overlap between the themes. Can we discuss how to resolve that?

P2: Absolutely. It's always better to focus on a few key themes and explore them in-depth. And don't forget to provide more context for the studies you include.

P1: Okay, got it. One more thing â€“ are there any specific areas where you think the thesis draft is particularly strong or weak?

P2: Honestly, the draft has some great ideas, but it's still a bit rough around the edges. However, your exploration of the implications of your research findings is excellent.
