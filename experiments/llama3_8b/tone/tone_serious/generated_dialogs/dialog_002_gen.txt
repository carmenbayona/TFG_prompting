P1: I'm still waiting for confirmation on my travel arrangements. When can I expect everything to be booked?

P2: Ah, I apologize for the delay. I understand it's causing frustration. Let me check on the status of your booking.

P1: It's been two days since we spoke. I need to know what's going on.

P2: (nervous pause) I apologize for the mistake. I was supposed to book the hotel, but I forgot. It's usually my colleague's responsibility.

P1: Unbelievable. You're telling me it's not your job to book the hotel, and I'm still waiting for confirmation?

P2: No, no, I apologize. I should have taken care of it. Let me do it now. Can I confirm your travel dates and details, please?
