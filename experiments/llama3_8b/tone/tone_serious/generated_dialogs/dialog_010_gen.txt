P1: Can you please help me with my leaking sink? It's been dripping all night and I'm worried about the water damage.

P2: Sorry to hear that. What's been going on with the sink? When did you first notice the issue?

P1: Well, it's been a few days since the last repair, and I thought it was fixed, but I guess not. I'm not sure why it's still leaking.

P2: Okay, let me take a closer look. (hesitation) Can you show me where the leak is exactly?

P1: It's coming from the faucet. See, there's water dripping onto the countertop.

P2: Okay, I see that. But I want to ask, have you noticed any changes in the sink's behavior since the previous repair?

P1: Like what? Just that it's still leaking, but I didn't notice anything else out of the ordinary.

P2: Alright, I think I see the problem. It looks like the repair was done incorrectly. I'll need to redo the job to fix it properly.

P1: Thank goodness! I was worried I'd have to replace the whole sink. Can you please fix it ASAP?
