P1: Good morning, Dr. Lee. I'm more than happy to discuss your thesis and offer any assistance I can. What seems to be the main issue you're facing?

P2: (hesitation) Ah, thank you, Dr. Patel. To be honest, I'm struggling to get started on my methodology section. I've been staring at the same sentence for hours, and I just can't seem to get it right.

P1: I understand how frustrating that can be. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to accomplish in that section? What specific challenges are you facing?

P2: (frustrated) It's just...I don't know where to begin. I've tried outlining, but it always seems too vague. And the literature review is overwhelming me. I feel like I'm not making any progress.

P1: Okay, let's break it down. Sometimes, a change of pace can help. Why don't we start with a smaller goal, like creating a simple framework for your methodology section? From there, we can work on expanding and refining it. Does that sound like a good place to start?
