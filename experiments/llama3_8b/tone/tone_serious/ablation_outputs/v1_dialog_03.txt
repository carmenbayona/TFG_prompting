Here is the conversation:

P1: I don't understand why I failed the exam again. I studied so hard.

P2: Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Take a deep breath, let's talk about it.

P1: (pausing) It's just... I've been preparing for months. I thought I was ready.

P2: I know how frustrating it must be. Did you review the material before the exam?

P1: (interrupting) No, no, it's not just that. I know I didn't review enough. But I thought my understanding of the concepts was solid.

P2: Okay, let's focus on what we can do next. Have you considered repeating the course?

P1: (hesitating) Yeah... yeah, maybe that's what I need to do. But I was really hoping to move on to the next level.
