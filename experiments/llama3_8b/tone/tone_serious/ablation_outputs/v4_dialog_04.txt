P2: I can understand why you're feeling that way. It's normal to feel disappointed when things don't go as planned.

P1: But I just don't understand why I failed. I studied really hard for that exam.
P2: Sometimes, despite our best efforts, things don't go as we expect. Can you tell me more about what you were studying and what you think might have contributed to your grade?

P1: Well, I think I might have gotten a little overwhelmed towards the end of the semester. And the questions on the exam seemed really tricky.
P2: It sounds like you might have been feeling a bit stressed, which can definitely affect performance. Have you considered repeating the course?

P1: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I just don't want to give up. But I'm also worried that repeating the course will set me back even further.
P2: Repeating the course can be a good idea, especially if you feel like you didn't quite grasp the material. And it's okay to take your time and focus on improving, rather than rushing to move on.
