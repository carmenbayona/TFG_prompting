P1: I just got my exam results and I failed. Can you believe it? I studied so hard, I don't understand why I didn't do better.

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that, it's really tough to get a bad result. Can you tell me what's going through your mind right now?

P1: Honestly, I'm really worried. I was counting on passing this course and now I feel like all my hard work was for nothing.

P2: You're not alone in feeling that way. Lots of people have to retake courses. What are your plans for now?

P1: I don't know... I was thinking of retaking the course, but I'm not sure if I can afford to. And what if I fail again?

P2: Let's take this one step at a time. Why don't we talk about the options for repeating the course? Maybe we can find a more affordable solution.

P1: Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. But what if I'm not good enough? What if I'm just not cut out for this?

P2: That's not true. You're a capable person, and you've got this far already. Sometimes it takes a little extra effort, but you can do it.
