P1: I'm really worried about my exam results. I didn't do well at all.
P2: Hi, sorry to hear that. What's going on? You're usually a strong student.

P1: I know, but I just feel like I didn't study enough. And now I'm worried that I'll have to repeat the course.
P2: Ah, I see. Repeating the course is not the end of the world. It happens to a lot of students. Can you tell me more about what you're worried about?

P1: (interrupting) Yes, exactly! I don't want to waste another semester. And I'm also worried about my parents finding out.
P2: Okay, let's take a deep breath. We can work through this together. What specific areas of the exam do you think you struggled with?

P1: (changing topic) I just feel like I'll never be able to catch up. What if I'm just not cut out for this major?
P2: Okay, let's take a step back. You're not thinking about your entire major based on one bad exam. Let's focus on what we can do to improve your performance this time around.
