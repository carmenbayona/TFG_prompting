P1: I just saw my exam results... and I'm really worried.  
P2: Ah, yeah. I was expecting you to come talk to me about this. How are you feeling about it?  
P1: Honestly, I'm devastated. I really studied hard for that exam. I don't understand why I didn't do better.  
P2: I know it's tough to see, but let's take a closer look. Your grades are below average, but not disastrous. It's not the end of the world.  
P1: (interrupting) But I was sure I had a good grasp of the material. I just don't get it. (pauses) Wait, what are my options? Can I retake the course?  
P2: Yes, you can retake the course. And I can help you prepare this time around. We can go over the material together, practice problems... you'll be fine.  
P1: (changing topic out of stress) Do you think I should just drop the course and take something else? Maybe something that's easier?  
P2: (calmly) I think you should focus on the course you're in. You've already invested time and energy into it. Plus, dropping a course might not be the best decision for your overall academic plan. Let's focus on moving forward, okay?
