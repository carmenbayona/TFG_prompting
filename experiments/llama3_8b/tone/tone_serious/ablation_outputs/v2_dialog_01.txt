P1: I just got my exam results and I failed. Again.

P2: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what happened?

P1: I don't know. I studied so hard, but I just couldn't seem to retain anything. I feel like I'm just not cut out for this.

P2: Well, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Sometimes people just need a little extra help or a different approach to learn. Have you considered repeating the course?

P1: (interrupting) No, no, I don't want to repeat the course. I've already wasted so much time and money. And what if I still fail again?

P2: (calmly) Okay, let's take a deep breath. Repeating the course doesn't have to be a bad thing. You can use this as an opportunity to really focus on your weaknesses and come back stronger.

P1: (hesitantly) I guess you're right. It's just hard to see right now. (pauses) Do you think I'll be able to get into a good school if I repeat the course?

P2: Of course you will. And even if it takes a little longer, it'll be worth it in the end. You'll come out of this with a better understanding of the material and a sense of accomplishment.
