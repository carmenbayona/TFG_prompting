P1: I don't understand why I didn't pass the exam. I studied hard for months.

P2: Sorry to hear that, Sarah. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling right now?

P1: (pausing, frustrated) I just feel like I let everyone down. My parents are going to be furious.

P2: (calmly) Sarah, stop for a moment. Let's think this through. What do you think you could have done differently?

P1: (interrupting) Oh, I know what I could've done differently! I could've studied more hours every day! (pausing) Wait, what was the question about?

P2: (smiling) Don't worry about that right now. So, what do you think about repeating the course? It's a common thing for students to do.

P1: (hesitant) I... I don't know. I don't want to waste another semester. But at the same time, I don't want to leave without knowing I did my best.
