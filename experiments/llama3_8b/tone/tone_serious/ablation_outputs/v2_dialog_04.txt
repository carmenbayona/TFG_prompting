P1: I don't understand why I failed the exam. I studied so hard.

P2: Hey, let's take a deep breath and go through it together, okay?

P1: No, it's just... I feel like I did everything right. I got good grades all semester.

P2: Okay, well, maybe we can break it down. Can you tell me what you thought the exam was going to cover?

P1: (interrupting) It's just that I thought I knew the material, you know? But apparently not.

P2: I know it's frustrating. Sometimes it's hard to see the things we're missing. Can you tell me what you've been doing wrong?

P1: (changing topic) I don't know. Maybe I should just retake the course.

P2: Actually, that might not be a bad idea. Sometimes repeating a course can really help you understand the material better.
