P1: I just got my exam results and I'm really worried, I failed again.
P2: Ah, I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

P1: I studied really hard, I don't understand why I didn't pass. I thought I was prepared.
P2: Okay, let's take a deep breath and try to break it down. Can you walk me through your study routine?

P1: I mean, I went over the notes, did all the practice questions, but... (pauses, then interrupts) Can we just pretend I didn't fail and we can move on to the next course? I really don't want to repeat the same thing.

P2: I understand why you'd want to do that, but let's not rush into anything. Repeating the course might be the best option right now. We can discuss that further.

P1: (nervously chuckles) Yeah, I guess you're right. So, what are my options? Should I just retake the exam or the whole course?

P2: Well, since you didn't pass the exam, I think it's best to retake the course. That way, you can review everything thoroughly and have a better chance of passing. And I'll be here to support you every step of the way.

P1: Okay, thank you for being so understanding. Just knowing I have your support makes me feel a bit better.
P2: That's what I'm here for.
