P1: I'm so worried about my exam results. I just got them and... (sighs) I didn't do well at all.  
P2: Sorry to hear that. What's going on? What are you thinking?  
P1: I just feel like I studied so hard, but... (interrupts) Do you think I should retake the course?  
P2: (calmly) Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Can you tell me more about your concerns with the exam? What did you find challenging?  
P1: (still worried) I just feel like I didn't understand the material as well as I thought I did. And some of the questions were really tricky. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Sorry, I'm getting worked up again.  
P2: (empathetic) It's okay to feel frustrated. But I want to help you understand where you can improve. Maybe we can break down the exam questions and go over them together? And if you do decide to retake the course, I can support you through that too.
