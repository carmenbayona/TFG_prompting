P1: I just got my exam results and I'm really disappointed. I didn't do as well as I thought I would.

P2: Ah, sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

P1: I don't know... I studied really hard, but I guess I didn't understand the material as well as I thought I did.

P2: It's okay, it's not the end of the world. What did you expect to get?

P1: (interrupting) I expected to pass, at least. I was counting on passing so I could move on to the next course.

P2: I understand how frustrating that must be. But maybe we can look at it this way... you can take the course again and do even better next time.
