P1: I just saw my exam results, and I'm really concerned.  
P2: I'm sorry to hear that. What did you think of the results when you saw them?  
P1: Honestly, I thought I did much better than this. I'm really worried about repeating the course.  
P2: I understand your concern, but we need to look at this objectively. Can I take a look at your results with you?  
P1: (interrupting) Yeah, sure. But can you just tell me if there was something I did wrong? I keep replaying the exam in my head and wondering what I could've done differently.  
P2: Let me take a look... Okay, I see. It looks like you struggled with a few specific areas, but with some extra effort, I think you can improve. And don't worry, repeating the course is a normal part of the learning process. Many students have to do it.  
P1: (changing topic out of stress) Do you think I should just take a gap year and then come back to it? That might be easier than repeating the whole course.  
P2: I understand your frustration, but I don't think that's the best solution. You've already put in so much effort, and repeating the course will give you a fresh start. Plus, I'll be here to support you and help you prepare this time.
