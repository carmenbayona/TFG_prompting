P1: So, I finally got my exam results and I'm really worried, I didn't do well at all.
P2: I'm sorry to hear that, can you tell me more about what happened?

P1: Yeah, I studied hard but I guess it wasn't enough. I don't understand why I failed, it's really frustrating.
P2: It's understandable to feel frustrated, but let's take a closer look at the results together. Maybe we can find some patterns or areas where you can improve.

P1: (pauses) Hmm, I don't know... I just feel like I did everything right. (interrupts) Wait, do you think I should retake the course?

P2: Well, retaking the course is definitely an option, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We need to understand why you failed first. Can you tell me more about your study habits and what you did differently this time around?

P1: (hesitates) Honestly, I think I got a little overwhelmed towards the end. And maybe I didn't focus as much as I should have on the most important topics.

P2: I see. It sounds like you might have been struggling with time management. But don't worry, we can work on that. And repeating the course might not be a bad idea if it means you can focus more on the areas that need improvement.

P1: Yeah, I guess you're right. I just feel so stressed about this, I don't know what to do.
P2: (calmly) You're not alone, okay? We'll get through this together. Let's make a plan and take it one step at a time.
