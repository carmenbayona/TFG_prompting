P1: I saw the exam results, and I'm really worried about them.  
P2: Yes, I noticed the scores too. Can you tell me what's going through your mind?  
P1: I just feel like I didn't do as well as I thought I would. I studied hard, but...  
P2: It's okay, let's take a closer look. What specific areas of the exam did you struggle with?  
P1: I don't know, I just felt like the questions were really tricky. And I'm worried that I won't be able to pass the course. (interrupts P2) Do you think I'll have to retake the course?  
P2: I think it's a possibility, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should talk to the instructor and get their feedback first. And if we do need to retake the course, we can work together to make a plan.  
P1: (pauses, then changes topic) I'm also stressed about the financial implications of repeating the course. It's going to put a strain on my budget. (P2 nods empathetically)
