P1: I'm really worried about my exam results, I could've sworn I studied hard enough for it.
P2: I understand your concern, but let's take a deep breath and go over the results together. What did the report say?

P1: I failed! I just can't believe it. I feel like I messed up so badly.
P2: Sorry to hear that, but don't be too hard on yourself. It's not uncommon for students to struggle the first time around. Can you tell me what you were most worried about on the exam?

P1: I think it was the math section. I just didn't understand the formulas and ended up rushing through it.
P2: Okay, that makes sense. Sometimes taking your time and reviewing the material more thoroughly can make a big difference. Have you considered repeating the course to get a better grasp on the material?

P1: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I don't want to give up, but at the same time, I don't want to waste another semester. I'm just feeling really overwhelmed right now.
P2: I totally get it. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. But honestly, repeating the course can be a great opportunity to learn from your mistakes and come back stronger. We can work through it together, okay?
