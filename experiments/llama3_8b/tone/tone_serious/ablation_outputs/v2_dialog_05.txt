P1: I don't understand why I failed that exam. I studied for weeks.

P2: Hey, don't worry, let's talk about this. What do you think went wrong?

P1: I don't know... I thought I was prepared. I got all the right answers on the practice test.

P2: Okay, so it's not like you didn't study. Sometimes these things happen. Did you have any issues during the exam itself?

P1: Yeah... actually, I was really anxious and my hands were shaking. Maybe that affected my performance.

P2: I see. Well, let's not jump to conclusions. Have you considered repeating the course? It's not uncommon for students to need more time or practice.

P1: (interrupting) Yeah, yeah, I know. But I was really hoping to pass it the first time around... I was counting on it for my future plans.
