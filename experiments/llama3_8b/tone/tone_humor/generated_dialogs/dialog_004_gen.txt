P1: So, I finally finished my thesis draft and I'm freaking out. Want to take a look and give me some feedback?

P2: Ah, congrats on finishing! Yeah, of course, I'd love to help. What's the main argument you're making?

P1: Hmm, well, I'm trying to say that... *pauses*... my weak literature review is gonna kill me. Ugh, I'm so worried about it.

P2: *laughs* Weak literature review? That's a bit dramatic, don't you think? But seriously, what do you plan on doing to strengthen it?

P1: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know... I just feel like I'm missing some key sources. You know, the ones that would really make my argument pop. But it's like, I don't know where to start! Do I add more recent sources or is that overkill?

P2: Okay, okay, let's break it down. What specific areas are you concerned about in your lit review?
