P1: Seriously, Steve, how many times do I have to remind you to be on time for our meetings? You're going to make me look bad in front of the team.

P2: Ah, come on, Rachel, don't be so dramatic. I'll be there, I promise. What's the big deal?

P1: The big deal is that you've missed the last three meetings, and it's starting to look like you're not taking this project seriously. We need to discuss some important stuff.

P2: Yeah, yeah, I know, sorry about that. Can I ask, is it because I'm always "forgetting" to set my alarm clock or something? I mean, I swear, it's like my brain just... uh... forgets to remember.

P1: (sigh) Okay, yes. It's because you always seem to "forget" these things. Look, I'll even set a reminder for you, if that'll help.

P2: Ha! Thanks, Rachel. You're a real lifesaver. I don't know what I'd do without you... or my own brain, for that matter.
