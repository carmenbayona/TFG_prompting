P1: Hey, have you seen my charger? I could swear I left it right here.

P2: Hmm, let me think... I was getting ready for work this morning, and I didn't notice anything unusual. But I did use my phone this morning to check the traffic on the way to the office.

P1: Wait, what? You used your phone this morning? But I know you always charge it overnight, right?

P2: Oh, yeah! I did charge it, but I just needed a quick top-up before I left the house. You know how it is when you're running late!

P1: (laughs) Yeah, I know the feeling! Okay, okay, so you used your phone, but did you happen to see my charger anywhere?

P2: (teasingly) Oh, I'm sure it's just hiding from you, like that one sock you can never find!
