P1: Hey, what's up? Want to have a movie night this weekend?

P2: Hmm, yeah, that sounds cool. What kind of movie are you thinking?

P1: I was thinking we could watch a sci-fi movie. I just got this new DVD of "Blade Runner" and I've been dying to check it out.

P2: Yeah, that's a classic. But, uh, don't you think it's kinda old?

P1: Old?! It's a classic! And it's got Harrison Ford in it. You can't go wrong with that.

P2: (laughs) Fair point. So, what's the plan for snacks? Are we gonna do the usual popcorn and chips thing?

P1: Oh, definitely. And maybe some pretzels too. I just got a new flavor of pretzels that I'm obsessed with. They're... they're... (dramatic pause) garlic parmesan!

P2: (laughs) Garlic parmesan? That sounds amazing. And disturbing. In a good way.
