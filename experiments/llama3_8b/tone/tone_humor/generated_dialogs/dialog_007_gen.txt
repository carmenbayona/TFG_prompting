P1: Hey, how's it going? I've been meaning to catch up with you.

P2: Oh, you know, just been lazy lately. Been watching way too much TV.

P1: Ah, I know the feeling! But you know what they say, "no pain, no gain"... or is that "no TV, no gain"?

P2: Uh, I think it's the second one. But seriously, I haven't been exercising in weeks. I'm starting to feel like a sloth.

P1: Haha, don't worry, I won't tell anyone! But seriously, have you thought about getting back into it? It's hard at first, but once you get into a routine...

P2: Yeah, I know, I know... I just keep putting it off. And with work and stuff, it's hard to find the time.

P1: Okay, okay, I get it. So, what's the first step? Just getting out of bed and putting on some comfy shoes?

P2: Hmm, that's a good start! Maybe I'll start with a short walk around the block. Not too much, just to get the blood flowing.

P1: That's it! Baby steps! And I'll join you, we can be fitness buddies!

P2: Oh, you're on! But don't expect me to keep up with you, I'm still a sloth.
