P1: Hey, man, I'm having some major issues with my internet connection. Can you help me troubleshoot?

P2: Ugh, what now? You know I hate dealing with tech stuff.

P1: I know, I know. But I've been trying to get it working for hours, and I'm going crazy. I've restarted the router, updated the firmware... nothing's working.

P2: Okay, okay. Let me take a look. But if it's the router again, I swear...

P1: Yeah, I know it's probably the router. We had issues with it last time too, remember? The one where it just stopped working for a whole day?

P2: Oh, yeah. And I'm still not convinced it was just a software glitch. I think it was possessed by the spirit of slow internet.

P1: (laughs) Yeah, that's probably it. Anyway, can you just check the physical connection and make sure it's secure?

P2: Fine. But if this is a waste of time, I'm blaming you.

P1: (laughs) Fair enough.
