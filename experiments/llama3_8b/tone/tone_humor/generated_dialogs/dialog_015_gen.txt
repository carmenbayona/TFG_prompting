P1: Ugh, I'm trying to book my train tickets for the trip, but the website is being super slow. Can you help me out?
P2: Ah, sorry about that! I'm happy to try. What's the problem, though? You're usually the tech-savvy one.
P1: Yeah, yeah, I know. But I swear, it's like they're trying to make it as hard as possible to buy tickets. Can you just check if the connection is stable or something?
P2: Hmm, let me see... *tap tap* Yeah, it looks fine on my end. Maybe try refreshing the page or something?
P1: I've tried that like five times already. It's like they're just trolling me at this point. Can we just call the customer service or something?
P2: Uh, well... I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I mean, I'm not exactly... uh... *ahem*... familiar with the whole customer service thing.
P1: What do you mean you're not familiar with it? You're the one who's always saying how great you are at problem-solving!
P2: Oh, yeah! I mean, I am great at problem-solving... in theory. But, you know, actually talking to customer service reps is a different story altogether.
