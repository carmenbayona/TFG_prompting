P1: Ugh, we really need to finalize the travel plans for the conference. Can you please just tell me what you've managed to book so far?
P2: Oh, sorry about that. I got held up with work and just got back from a meeting. Let me check my emails... Hmm, it seems I booked the wrong dates for the hotel.
P1: What?! That's not what I asked you to do! Now we're going to be stuck with a weird commute and no decent food nearby.
P2: I'm so sorry, I feel awful about this. I know I told you I'd take care of it, and I just... forgot. Can I make it up to you by getting us a better flight deal?
P1: A better flight deal isn't going to fix the hotel situation. And what's with the last-minute task you assigned me to book the airport shuttle? You know I'm not exactly a travel expert.
P2: Yeah, I remember saying that, and then I just got busy and forgot. You're right, it's on me. I should've followed through. Can I grab coffee with you tomorrow and help you figure out the logistics?
P1: Fine, but just for coffee. And try to get your act together before we leave, okay? I don't want to have to deal with your apologetic face every five minutes.
P2: I will, I promise. And hey, at least our flight isn't leaving till late afternoon, so we have some buffer time to sort things out.
P1: Yeah, I suppose you're right. See you tomorrow, coffee and complaints ahead!
