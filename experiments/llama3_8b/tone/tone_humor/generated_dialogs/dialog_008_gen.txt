P1: So, Emma's birthday is coming up and I'm stuck for gift ideas. Do you have any suggestions?

P2: Ah, yeah! I've got a few. What's her style? You know, is she more into games, books, or something else?

P1: Hmm, she loves fantasy novels, so maybe something book-related? But I don't want to give her more books to read.

P2: (laughs) Fair point! So, have you thought about getting her tickets to a concert? There's this new fantasy-themed band that's all the rage...

P1: Concert tickets? That's a great idea! But which concert? And have you checked their schedule?

P2: (pauses) Uh, not yet. But it's worth a shot, right? I mean, Emma would love that kind of music.

P1: Yeah, she would! Thanks for the suggestion! You're a lifesaver!

P2: No problem! Just trying to help. So, you gonna look into those concert tickets?

P1: Yeah, definitely. Thanks again!
