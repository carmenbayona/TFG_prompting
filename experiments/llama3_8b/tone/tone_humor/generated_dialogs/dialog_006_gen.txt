P1: I'm telling you, Doc, I've been feeling awful all morning. My head is killing me, I'm dizzy as can be, and I'm exhausted. What's going on?

P2: Okay, okay, let's start with the headache. When did it start and how bad is it?

P1: Uh, it started last night, I think. It's like a dull ache, but it's everywhere. And don't even get me started on the dizzy spells. I almost fell down the stairs this morning.

P2: Hmm, interesting. And have you noticed any other symptoms? Fatigue, perhaps?

P1: Fatigue? Ha! I'm not just tired, I'm exhausted. I couldn't even get out of bed until hours after my alarm went off.

P2: Alright, so we have a headache, dizziness, and fatigue. I'm going to run some tests, but in the meantime, have you been getting enough sleep?
