P1: Seriously, it's been three weeks and I still don't have my new laptop. When am I gonna get it?

P2: I'm so sorry to hear that, P1. Let me check on the status for you. (pause) Okay, it looks like there was an issue with the shipping company.

P1: (sigh) Of course. Because that's exactly what I wanted to hear. An "issue" with the shipping company. Can I get a refund at least?

P2: Absolutely, P1. I can process a refund for you right away. However, I do want to let you know that we're also going to expedite the shipping of your laptop.

P1: (sarcastically) Oh, great. Because nothing makes up for a three-week delay like getting it in two days. Just give me my money back and be done with it.

P2: (laughing) Alright, alright. I get it. Let me just process that refund for you. I'm going to go ahead and throw in a 10% discount on your next purchase as well.

P1: (mildly annoyed) Whatever, just get it done. And can you please make sure this discount doesn't expire in like, a week?

P2: (laughing) Of course not, P1. We wouldn't do that to you. I'll make sure the discount is valid for six months.
