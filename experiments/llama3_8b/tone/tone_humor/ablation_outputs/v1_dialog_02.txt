P1: Oh, dude, I've got the most epic surprise planned for you! You're not going to believe it!

P2: What's going on? Why are you acting so weird?

P1: You'll see, trust me! Just get your bags ready and... uh... pack some extra clothes.

P2: What's with the packing? Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

P1: No way, man! It's just... you know, a little trip. A weekend getaway... or something.

P2: A weekend getaway? That's weird. Who are you planning to kidnap and where are we going?

P1: Uh, just some friends. Yeah, friends. We're going to, uh, a beach. A really cool beach.

P2: A beach? You're taking me to a beach without my consent? That sounds like a kidnapping to me!

P1: No, no, no! We're just... going to... uh... hang out. Yeah, that's it. Hang out.

P2: I don't know what's going on, but I'm calling the authorities. What's going on, seriously?!
