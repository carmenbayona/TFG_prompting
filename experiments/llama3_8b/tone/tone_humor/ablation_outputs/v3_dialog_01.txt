Here is the generated dialog:

P1: Hey, I've got a surprise for you! Pack a bag, we're going out of town tomorrow.
P2: What's going on? Am I getting kidnapped?
P1: Ha! No, no, it's just a little trip. Trust me, you'll love it.
P2: A little trip? You're being really cryptic. Where are we going?
P1: Oh, um, it's a surprise. Just get your stuff ready and you'll see.
P2: I don't like where this is going. Are you pranking me or something?
P1: No, I swear! We're going to have a blast. And, uh, don't forget your sunscreen.
P2: Sunscreen? You're really building up my paranoia. What's the real story?
P1: Okay, fine. Let's just say it's a beach vacation. Happy now?
P2: A beach vacation? You told me it was a surprise. I thought it was something more... exciting.
P1: (laughs) Oh, it's exciting, trust me. You'll see when we get there.
