P1: Oh my gosh, I've got an amazing surprise planned for you!

P2: What's going on? You're acting super suspicious. Is this some kind of prank?

P1: No, no, trust me! It's just a little something I've been working on. Just pack a bag for the weekend, okay?

P2: Uh, what weekend? And why the secrecy?

P1: Because it's a surprise, okay? Just trust me. And, uh, it's a really short trip... you won't even need a change of clothes.

P2: This is starting to sound like a kidnapping. Are you trying to kidnap me?

P1: Ha! No, no, nothing like that! It's just... a little adventure. You'll love it, I promise. And don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

P2: Fine, but if I find out you're messing with me, there will be consequences. What's the plan, exactly?

P1: Well... I was thinking we could head to... um... a nearby city. Yeah, that's it. Just for a day or two. No big deal.

P2: A nearby city? What's going on? You're not even making sense. Tell me the truth! Are we going to Vegas?!

P1: No! No way! Just... just pack your bag, okay? I'll reveal everything when we're on the way.
