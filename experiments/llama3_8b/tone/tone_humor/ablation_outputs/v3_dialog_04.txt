Here is the generated dialog:

P1: Dude, we need to start packing for the weekend.
P2: What's going on? Why are we packing?
P1: Just a little getaway, you know?
P2: A getaway? How did I not know about this? Why are you being so vague?
P1: I'm just trying to keep it a surprise!
P2: Surprise? You're trying to kidnap me or something, aren't you?
P1: Ha! No, no, nothing like that. It's just a fun trip, I promise.
P2: Then why won't you tell me where we're going?
P1: Because I don't want to ruin the surprise! You just have to trust me on this one.
P2: Trust you? You're not even telling me what city we're in. This is crazy.
P1: Okay, fine. We're going somewhere with beaches. Happy now?
P2: Beaches? This is getting stranger by the minute. Are you sure I'm going to like this?
