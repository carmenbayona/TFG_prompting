P1: Oh man, I've got the most epic surprise planned for you! You're going to love it!

P2: Huh? What's going on? Why do I need to "love" something? Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

P1: Ha! No way, I promise it's legit. You just need to pack a small bag and we're good to go!

P2: Wait, where are we going? How long will we be gone? And why do I need to pack a small bag? Are we going camping or something?

P1: Hmm, well... let's just say it's a "quick getaway". You'll love the scenery, trust me!

P2: Scenery? You're not making any sense. Are you trying to prank me? This is ridiculous!

P1: Okay, okay, I might have slipped up a little. Let's just say it's a place you've always wanted to see. And I promise, it's not a prank!

P2: I don't know what's going on, but I'm starting to get really worried. Are you kidnapping me? Can I have a lawyer?

P1: Oh, come on! It's just a little trip, I swear! We can even make it a mini-vacation, if you want!

P2: Fine. But if I get hurt or kidnapped, I'm never speaking to you again. And I'm bringing a lawyer.
