P1: Dude, I've got an amazing surprise for you!
P2: What's going on? You're acting super weird.
P1: No, no, it's just... I've been feeling really down lately, and I need a pick-me-up.
P2: Okay, Captain Obvious, what's the surprise?
P1: (pausing) Uh, let's just say it involves a trip.
P2: (skeptical) A trip? What kind of trip? You're not planning on kidnapping me or something, are you?
P1: (laughs) No, no, nothing like that! I promise I'm not going to kidnap you... unless you're really, really bad at math. Just kidding!
P2: (sarcastic) Oh, great, because math is the key to whether or not you'll kidnap me.
P1: (accidentally slips a hint) And... think tropical.
P2: (repeats question) What kind of trip? Stop giving me vague answers!
P1: (hides the truth) Oh, it's just a little something I found online. It's a... a... a "relaxation retreat" or something.
P2: (raises an eyebrow) A relaxation retreat? You're not going to tell me what it is, are you?
P1: (whispers) Trust me, it'll be fun, I promise! Just pack a bag and come with me.
P2: (hesitates) I don't know, man... this feels fishy.
P1: (persistent) Come on, it'll be a blast! You can't miss it!
