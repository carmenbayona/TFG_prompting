P1: Oh, you're going to love this! I've planned an amazing surprise trip for us!

P2: What's going on? Why do I have to pack a bag without knowing where we're going?

P1: Trust me, it'll be an adventure of a lifetime! Just throw some clothes in a bag and we'll figure it out when we get there.

P2: This sounds suspicious. Are you kidding me? Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

P1: Ha! No, no, no! It's just a little surprise I've been planning. And I swear, it's nothing to worry about. Just leave the details to me.

P2: Okay, fine. But if I get left in some weird forest or something, I'm blaming you.

P1: That's the spirit! Now, let me just... uh... "accidentally" pack a destination guide with some tropical flowers on the cover. Hehe, you'll love it!

P2: Wait, what's that? Why is there a picture of palm trees and a beach on the guide?

P1: Oh, uh, must be a... a new type of flower? Yeah, that's it! Just a random flower guide. Don't worry about it.

P2: You know what? I don't think I want to know what's going on. Just give me my ticket and take me to wherever you're taking me.
