P1: Oh man, I've been planning the most epic surprise trip for us! You're gonna love it!

P2: Wait, what's going on? Why are you being so cryptic?

P1: I'm just excited, that's all! You'll see soon enough. Trust me, it'll be amazing.

P2: Trust you? You're being really weird about this. Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

P1: Ha! No, no, nothing like that! I just... uh... need you to pack a bag for us. Yeah, that's it. Just bring some essentials.

P2: Essentials? What kind of essentials? And where are we going?

P1: Oh, just the usual stuff. Clothes, toiletries... and, uh, maybe a good book or two. As for where we're going... let's just say it's a place you've always wanted to visit.

P2: A place I've always wanted to visit? How would I know that? And what's with the secrecy?

P1: I... uh... slipped up, didn't I? Just forget I said that. Let's just focus on getting packed, okay?

P2: You're really freaking me out. I think you're planning some kind of prank or something. Tell me what's going on!

P1: Okay, okay! Fine. I'll tell you. But you have to promise not to tell anyone else. We're going... to Hawaii!

P2: Hawaii?! That's not a prank?! Wait, how did you know I've always wanted to visit Hawaii?!

P1: Good guess, huh? Now, let's get packing!
