P1: Oh man, I have the best surprise for you! You're going to love this!

P2: What is it? Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

P1: No, no, no! Just a little getaway, trust me. You need a break from the daily grind.

P2: Hmm, I don't know...I'm not exactly a fan of surprises. What's going on?

P1: Nothing, nothing! Just a spontaneous trip to...you know, a really nice beach. Yeah, that's it!

P2: Which beach? Is this some kind of prank?

P1: *ahem* A, uh, a beach in a nearby country. It's totally legit, I swear!

P2: Wait, you're not even telling me where we're going, are you?

P1: Of course I am! I just need you to pack a bag without asking too many questions.

P2: You're really freaking me out, you know that? What's going on here?

P1: Nothing, I promise! It's just a quick weekend trip. You'll love it, I promise!

P2: *sigh* Fine, but if I end up on a deserted island, I'm blaming you.
