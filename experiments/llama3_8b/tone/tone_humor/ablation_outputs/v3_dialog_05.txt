Here is the generated dialog:

P1: Hey, pack a bag for tonight!
P2: What's going on? Are you kidnapping me?
P1: No, no, no! I'm just... going on a little trip. You know, for work.
P2: At midnight? Sounds suspicious.
P1: It's just a... a meeting. Yeah, a meeting that's really important.
P2: A meeting that requires a bag and secrecy? You're not even making it subtle, are you?
P1: I swear, it's legit! I'll tell you all about it on the way. Just grab a bag.
P2: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where we're going. This is some kind of prank, right?
P1: Oh, it's not a prank! We're just... going to a... a very nice place. You'll love it, trust me.
P2: You're not even denying it. I'm onto you.
