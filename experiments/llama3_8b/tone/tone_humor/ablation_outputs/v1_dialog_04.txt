P2: What? What's going on? Why are you being so secretive?

P1: Oh, no reason, I just like the element of surprise, you know? It's gonna be awesome, trust me.

P2: Trust you? You're always getting us into trouble, remember that time with the food truck festival?

P1: That was just one little mishap! This is gonna be great, I promise. Pack a bag, and you'll see.

P2: A mystery destination? You're really doing this, aren't you? Are you pranking me?

P1: Pranking you? No way! I would never do that. I just want to, uh, surprise you. Yeah, that's it.

P1: Wait, no clues! Just pack a bag and show up at the airport at 6 am. That's all you need to know.

P2: You're really going to make me do this, aren't you? Alright, I'm packing, but if this is a prank...
