P1: Oh man, I'm so stoked! We're going on a surprise trip!
P2: What? What's going on? Who's "we"?
P1: Ah, you'll see. Just pack a bag, trust me!
P2: Pack a bag? What's going on? Where are we going? Is this a prank?
P1: No, no, no! It's not a prank, I swear! Just... uh... it's a surprise, okay?
P2: A surprise? You're starting to freak me out, dude. What's going on?
P1: Okay, okay... we're going... somewhere warm... with beaches... and stuff.
P2: With beaches? You're not even going to give me a straight answer, are you? Are you kidnapping me?
P1: Whoa, no! Just... just... you have to trust me on this one, okay?
P2: Fine, but if I end up in some weird cult or something, I'm blaming you.
P1: Haha, no cults, I promise! Just... just get your bag ready!
