P1: Oh man, I've got the best surprise for you! You're going to love this!
P2: What's going on? Why are you being so weird?
P1: Nothing, nothing! Just a little treat for my favorite person. Pack a bag, you're going out of town for a bit.
P2: Whoa, hold up. Where are we going? Is this some kind of prank?
P1: Uh, no, no prank. Just a little relaxing getaway. Trust me, you'll love it.
P2: But I don't want to relax! And what's with the secrecy? You're being super weird about this.
P1: (accidentally) Oh, we're going to the beach! You love the beach, right?
P2: Wait, what?! How did you know that?! This is starting to freak me out. Are you kidnapping me or something?
P1: Ha! No, no! Just a little surprise. Don't worry about it. You'll see when we get there.
P2: I don't want to see anything until I know what's going on. Tell me what's really happening.
