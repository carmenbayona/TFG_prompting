Where are we going?\"\n\n**Turn 3**\nP1: \"Oh, it's a wonderful place with lots of sunshine and fresh air. You'll love it!\"\n\n**Turn 4**\nP2: \"Hmm, that sounds weird. Is it a spa or something? Like, a yoga retreat in a hot desert?\"\n\n**Turn 5**\nP1: \"Ha ha, no, it's not a spa. But you will get to relax and unwind, I promise.\"\n\n**Turn 6**\nP2: \"Okay, okay. I'll keep guessing. Is it a theme park? Like, a giant water park in the middle of the ocean?\"\n\n**Turn 7**\nP1: \"Uh, no... it's not a theme park. But you will see some amazing natural wonders.\"\n\n**Turn 8**\nP2: \"Alright, I think I've got it! Is it a llama farm in the Andes? No? Okay, fine. Did you rent a villa in Antarctica?\"\n\nP1: \"Uh... yeah, actually, it is a bit chilly there... and snowy... (Oops, did I say too much?)\"\n\nP2: \"HA! I knew it! You're plotting something!
