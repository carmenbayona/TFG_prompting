Here is a dialog between two characters, Alex and Mia:

**Alex:** Hey, Mia. How's it going?

**Mia:** Not bad, Alex. Just got back from a long weekend. How about you?

**Alex:** Same here. I spent the whole weekend binge-watching Netflix and eating pizza. I think I gained five pounds.

**Mia:** (laughs) That sounds like a great weekend to me. I wish I could've joined you. What was your favorite show?

**Alex:** Oh, definitely "The Office". I must've watched every episode five times. I'm starting to think I'm Michael Scott in disguise.

**Mia:** (laughs) That's hilarious. I'm more of a "Game of Thrones" person myself. I'm still reeling from that shocking finale.

**Alex:** Yeah, I know what you mean. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Do you think they'll do a spin-off?

**Mia:** I hope so. I'd love to see more of Daenerys' world. But what about you? Are you going to keep watching "The Office" or move on to something new?

**Alex:** I think I need to take a break from Dunder Mifflin. I'm starting to feel like I'm part of the office. But I do have a new show to check out - my friend just recommended "Stranger Things".

**Mia:** Oh, yeah! I loved that show. It's so nostalgic and creepy at the same time. You should totally check it out.

**Alex:** Will do. Thanks for the rec. Maybe we can even have a marathon viewing party soon?

**Mia:** Sounds like a plan to me!
