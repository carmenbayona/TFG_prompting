Here is the conversation:

**Turn 1: P1**
Hey, P2! I have a surprise for you! I've been planning a trip and I think you'll love it. Can you please start packing your bag?

**Turn 2: P2**
A surprise? What does that even mean? Where are we going? And why do I need to pack already? Is it some kind of emergency?

**Turn 3: P1**
Ha ha, no emergency! I just want to make it a special surprise. Trust me, you'll love it. Just pack a few essentials like clothes and toiletries. That's all I'll say for now.

**Turn 4: P2**
Okay, fine. But you're really not making this easy, are you? I'm starting to think it's some kind of prank. Is it Antarctica? Are we going to the South Pole?

**Turn 5: P1**
Ha ha, no, not Antarctica! That's a great guess, though. Let's just say it's a "unique" destination. Pack some comfortable shoes, okay?

**Turn 6: P2**
Unique destination, huh? Is it a llama farm, then? I've always wanted to see llamas up close.

**Turn 7: P1**
(laughs nervously) Oh, no, no llama farm! But you're on the right track with the "unique" part. Just remember to pack for different weather conditions. You don't want to be caught off guard.

**Turn 8: P2**
(raises an eyebrow) Weather conditions, huh? So it's not a desert or a tropical island, then? Is it... (pauses, looking thoughtful) ...a city that has a lot of rain?!

**P1:** (accidentally) Oh, yeah, it does rain there... just a little.

**P2:** (excitedly) AHA! I KNEW IT! IS IT SEATTLE?!
