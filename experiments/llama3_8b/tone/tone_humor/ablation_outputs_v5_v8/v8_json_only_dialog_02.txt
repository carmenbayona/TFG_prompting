Here is a dialog between two characters, Alex and Maya:

**Setting:** A small caf√© on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Alex and Maya are sitting at a tiny table by the window, sipping their lattes.

**Alex:** So, Maya, what's been going on in your life lately? Any new projects or adventures?

**Maya:** Actually, yeah! I just got a new job offer in San Francisco. I'm thinking about taking it.

**Alex:** Whoa, that's huge! What's the company like?

**Maya:** It's a startup, and they're doing some really innovative work in sustainability. I'm really excited about the opportunity to be a part of it.

**Alex:** That sounds amazing. But are you sure you're ready to make the move? You've been here for years, and your family is here...

**Maya:** Yeah, I know. And it's not an easy decision. But I feel like I need a change of scenery, you know? I want to challenge myself and see what else is out there.

**Alex:** I totally get that. But what about your friends? We're going to miss you so much!

**Maya:** Aw, thanks, Alex. That means a lot to me. But I'll stay in touch, I promise. And who knows, maybe you can come visit me in SF sometime.

**Alex:** Definitely. So, when are you thinking of making the move?

**Maya:** The company wants me to start in three weeks, so I've got about that long to wrap up my current project and say goodbye to everyone.

**Alex:** Well, we'll make sure to give you a proper sendoff. So, what's the plan for the next three weeks?

**Maya:** Just trying to tie up loose ends and enjoy the time I have left here. And maybe have a few more coffee dates with you, of course!

**Alex:** (laughs) Of course! We'll make sure to squeeze in as many coffee dates as we can.

Maya smiles and takes a sip of her latte, lost in thought as she considers her next move.
