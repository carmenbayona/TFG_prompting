**Turn 1**
P1: Hey, I've been thinking about taking a surprise trip soon! I've got everything planned out, and I think you'll really love it.
P2: (skeptical) Oh yeah? What's the trip for? Birthday, anniversary, or just a random Tuesday treat?

**Turn 2**
P1: Ha! No, it's not a special occasion. I just wanted to do something nice for you. Can I ask you to pack a bag without telling you where we're going?
P2: (playfully suspicious) Uh, sure... why not? But you're not gonna put me on a spaceship to Mars or something, are you?

**Turn 3**
P1: (laughs) No, nothing that crazy! Just... trust me, okay?
P2: (still skeptical) Fine... but you're not gonna make me walk the Great Wall of China or anything, right?

**Turn 4**
P1: (drops vague hint) Well, the weather's been pretty mild lately, so you should pack accordingly.
P2: (confused) Wait, what? You're telling me the weather? That's like giving away the whole surprise! (jokingly) Oh, I get it! We're going to the sun!

**Turn 5**
P1: (laughs) No, not the sun! (accidentally reveals tiny detail) And, um, it's not super hot either, actually.
P2: (picking up on the hint) Ooh, so it's not hot, but the weather's mild... Hmm, could it be... Antarctica?

**Turn 6**
P1: (laughs) No, not Antarctica! But you're getting warm, I'll give you that. (drops another vague hint) Let's just say you'll see some... interesting architecture.
P2: (excitedly) Ooh, is it a llama farm?!
