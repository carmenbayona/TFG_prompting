P1: Oh man, I'm so excited to tell you about this surprise trip I've planned!
P2: What's going on? You've been acting super shady all week.
P1: Shady?! I'm just really passionate about... travel.
P2: Save it, I know you're up to something. Is it a trip to Antarctica?
P1: Ha! No, not Antarctica... but I do know someone who has a fascinating collection of penguins.
P2: Okay, okay, so it's a llama farm, right?
P1: Um, no... but have you ever heard of a place with super fluffy clouds?
P2: Geez, you're really making me work for this. Did you book a trip to a cloud farm?
P1: *accidentally* Oh, yeah, the weather is going to be just... um, cloudy.
P2: Wait, what?! You're really going to cloud farm?!
