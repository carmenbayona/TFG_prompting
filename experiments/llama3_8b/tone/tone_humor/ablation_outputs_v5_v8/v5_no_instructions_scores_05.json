You're not planning on dumping me at a llama farm, are you?\"\n\n**P1:** \"Ha! No, nothing like that! I just thought it would be fun to take a spontaneous trip. You know, just the two of us.\"\n\n**P2:** \"Spontaneous trip? You've been planning this for weeks, I can tell! What's the weather like where we're going? Is it sunny?\"\n\n**P1:** \"Uh, yeah... it's... sunny-ish. But that's not important. Just pack your bags and we'll figure out the rest when we get there.\"\n\n**P2:** \"Sunny-ish? That's not very specific. Are we going to the moon? I bet it's sunny there during the day...\"\n\n**P1:** \"No, no, it's not the moon! Just... trust me on this one, okay? And don't worry, it's not Antarctica either...\"\n\n**P2:** \"Wait, you're not telling me anything! Are we going to a secret underground bunker or something? Do you have a friend who has one of those?\"\n\n**P1:** \"No, nothing like that! Just... just pack your bags and come with me, okay?\"\n\n**P2:** \"Okay, fine... but if we end up at a llama farm, I'm blaming you...\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to add any additional lines!",
