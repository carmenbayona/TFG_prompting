I've been thinking about booking a surprise trip and I really want you to come!\"\n\nP2: \"A surprise trip? That sounds suspicious. Where are we going, exactly?\"\n\nP1: \"Oh, I'm not saying just yet! But trust me, it'll be an adventure you'll never forget. Just pack your bags and be ready for anything!\"\n\nP2: \"Hmm, okay... but I'm guessing we're not going to Antarctica, are we?\"\n\nP1: \"Ha! No, definitely not Antarctica. But I will say that we'll be somewhere with a pretty unique climate. The weather is going to be... interesting.\"\n\nP2: \"Unique climate? Like, hot and humid? Or cold and snowy? Or... maybe it's a llama farm?\"\n\nP1: \"Uh, no. Not a llama farm. But I will give you a hint: it's somewhere with a lot of water. Just think about that and see if you can guess where we're going.\"\n\nP2: \"Water, huh? Okay... so it's not the ocean. Is it a lake? Or maybe a hot spring? Oh wait, I know! Is it a giant water slide?\"\n\nP1: \"Ha! No, it's not a giant water slide. But I will say that we'll be doing some water activities. Just think about what that might be and see if you can figure out where we're headed.\"\n\nP2: \"Water activities? Like, surfing? Or kayaking? Or... maybe it's a mermaid aquarium?\"\n\nP1: \"Uh, not a mermaid aquarium. But I will give you one more hint: we'll be sleeping in a place with a very interesting architectural design.\"\n\nP2: \"Interesting architectural design? Like, a yurt? Or a treehouse? Or... maybe it's a giant clamshell?\"\n\nP1: \"Ha! No, it's not a giant clamshell. But I think that's all I'm going to say for now. You'll just have to wait and see where we're going!\"",
