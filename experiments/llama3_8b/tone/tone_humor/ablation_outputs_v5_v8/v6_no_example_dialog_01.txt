P1: Hey, I've got a surprise for you! Pack your bags, we're going on a trip!

P2: What, another one of your harebrained schemes? Where are we off to this time?

P1: Hmm, let's just say it's a place with a lot of sunshine.

P2: Antarctica? You're planning a surprise trip to Antarctica?

P1: *laughs* Oh, no, nothing that cold! Just... warm sunshine. Yeah.

P2: Llama farm? You're taking me to a llama farm?

P1: *chuckles* Not exactly. But we might see some llamas.

P2: Okay, I'm guessing a tropical island with a llama rental service...

P1: *hesitates* Uh, something like that. Just... don't worry about the details, okay?

P2: You're really bad at this, you know? Last time you surprised me with a trip to the in-laws' house for Thanksgiving. That was... memorable.

P1: *laughs* Hey, that wasn't a bad idea! The in-laws loved it!

P2: *skeptical* Yeah, I'm sure they did.
