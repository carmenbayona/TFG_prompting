P1: Oh man, I'm so excited for our surprise trip! You're going to love it!

P2: What surprise trip? You're not even telling me where we're going, are you?

P1: Uh, no... it's a surprise! But trust me, it'll be amazing!

P2: Save it, I've seen some of these tactics before. Are we going to a llama farm?

P1: Hmm, no... why would we go to a llama farm? That's not even a real vacation spot!

P2: Oh, come on! You're not telling me because it's Antarctica, aren't you?

P1: Uh, no... it's definitely not Antarctica! Although, I did hear it's going to be a bit chilly when we get there.

P2: See, I knew it! You're taking me to the North Pole and making me ice-sculpture for the rest of the trip!

P1: (laughs) No, no, no! That's not even close! Just trust me, you'll love it. Pack your bags and I'll reveal everything when we get there!

P2: Fine, but if I end up in a bird sanctuary, I'm blaming you!
