I've got everything planned out, and I think you'll really love it.\nP2: (skeptical) Oh yeah? What's the trip for? Birthday, anniversary, or just a random Tuesday treat?\n\n**Turn 2**\nP1: Ha! No, it's not a special occasion. I just wanted to do something nice for you. Can I ask you to pack a bag without telling you where we're going?\nP2: (playfully suspicious) Uh, sure... why not? But you're not gonna put me on a spaceship to Mars or something, are you?\n\n**Turn 3**\nP1: (laughs) No, nothing that crazy! Just... trust me, okay?\nP2: (still skeptical) Fine... but you're not gonna make me walk the Great Wall of China or anything, right?\n\n**Turn 4**\nP1: (drops vague hint) Well, the weather's been pretty mild lately, so you should pack accordingly.\nP2: (confused) Wait, what? You're telling me the weather? That's like giving away the whole surprise! (jokingly) Oh, I get it! We're going to the sun!\n\n**Turn 5**\nP1: (laughs) No, not the sun! (accidentally reveals tiny detail) And, um, it's not super hot either, actually.\nP2: (picking up on the hint) Ooh, so it's not hot, but the weather's mild... Hmm, could it be... Antarctica?\n\n**Turn 6**\nP1: (laughs) No, not Antarctica! But you're getting warm, I'll give you that. (drops another vague hint) Let's just say you'll see some... interesting architecture.\nP2: (excitedly) Ooh, is it a llama farm?!",
