P1: Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to plan this surprise trip for us!
P2: What's going on? You've been acting super sneaky lately.
P1: Nothing, nothing! Just a little something I've been thinking about. You'll love it, I promise!
P2: Hmm, that sounds suspicious. Is it to the moon? I've always wanted to visit the moon.
P1: Ha! No, no, it's definitely not the moon. But I will say that the weather will be... unpredictable.
P2: Unpredictable, huh? Is that code for "it's going to be freezing in Antarctica"?
P1: No way, it's definitely not that cold! But I will say that we might need some special gear.
P2: Special gear? Like llama farm gear? I've heard those places can get pretty rugged.
P1: Um, no. Definitely not a llama farm. But I do think we'll need something to keep us dry.
P2: Dry? Like on a desert island? I've always wanted to visit a desert island.
P1: No, it's not a desert island... but I do think we'll have some amazing views.
P2: Views? Like from the top of a skyscraper? I've heard those cities can get pretty windy.
P1: No, it's not a city... but I do think we'll feel very small.
P2: Small? Like in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere? I've heard those places can get pretty... deserted.
P1: Okay, okay, I think I've said too much. Just pack your bags and trust me, you'll love it!
P2: Fine, but if we end up in a llama farm, I'm blaming you!
