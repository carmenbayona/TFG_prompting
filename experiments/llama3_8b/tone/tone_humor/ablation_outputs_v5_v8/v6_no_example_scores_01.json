  "Dialog": "P1: Hey, I've got a surprise for you! Pack your bags, we're going on a trip!\n\nP2: What, another one of your harebrained schemes? Where are we off to this time?\n\nP1: Hmm, let's just say it's a place with a lot of sunshine.\n\nP2: Antarctica? You're planning a surprise trip to Antarctica?\n\nP1: *laughs* Oh, no, nothing that cold! Just... warm sunshine. Yeah.\n\nP2: Llama farm? You're taking me to a llama farm?\n\nP1: *chuckles* Not exactly. But we might see some llamas.\n\nP2: Okay, I'm guessing a tropical island with a llama rental service...\n\nP1: *hesitates* Uh, something like that. Just... don't worry about the details, okay?\n\nP2: You're really bad at this, you know? Last time you surprised me with a trip to the in-laws' house for Thanksgiving. That was... memorable.\n\nP1: *laughs* Hey, that wasn't a bad idea! The in-laws loved it!\n\nP2: *skeptical* Yeah, I'm sure they did.",
