P1: Dude, I've got an amazing surprise for you!
P2: What is it? You're not going to make me do some ridiculous scavenger hunt or something, are you?
P1: Uh, nope, nothing like that. Just pack a bag, and we'll get there.
P2: Hmm, okay... you're really mysterious about this, aren't you? I bet it's to Hawaii.
P1: *laughs* Oh, no way! It's not warm and sunny, that's for sure. 
P2: Ooh, so it must be Antarctica! You're taking me on a polar expedition!
P1: *laughs* No, no, nothing like that. Just... wear layers, okay?
P2: Ha! I knew it! You're a llama farmer and you're taking me to a llama farm!
P1: *laughs* You're really close, though! I mean, there are llamas everywhere...
P2: Wait, what? Are you serious?!
P1: Shh, just pack the bag and trust me!
