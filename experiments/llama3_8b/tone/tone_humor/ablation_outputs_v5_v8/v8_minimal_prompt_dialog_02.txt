Here is the conversation:

**Turn 1**
P1: Oh, guess what?! I'm planning a surprise trip! And I think you should come with me!
P2: (skeptical) Uh, what's the occasion? Why the sudden surprise?

**Turn 2**
P1: (excitedly) Oh, it's just a whim! I thought it would be fun to get away for a bit. And I knew you needed a break from work!
P2: (playing along) Hmm, that sounds intriguing. But where are we going? Can you at least give me a hint?
P1: (teasingly) Oh no, no hints! You'll just have to be surprised!

**Turn 3**
P2: (jokingly) Okay, okay. But I'm guessing it's not Antarctica... right?
P1: (laughing) Oh, no, no way! Not Antarctica! (accidentally) Unless... the weather is a bit... chilly?

**Turn 4**
P2: (excitedly) Ooh, chilly? That sounds like it could be anywhere! Is it a llama farm in Peru?
P1: (distracted) What? No, no llamas! (pulls out a travel brochure) Look at this! It's a beautiful picture...

**Turn 5**
P2: (confused) Wait, what's that supposed to mean? Is it a beach destination? Are you going to dump me on a deserted island again like that one time?

**Turn 6**
P1: (laughing) Oh, no! This is nothing like that! (drops a vague hint) Let's just say it's a place where the sun doesn't always shine...

**Turn 7**
P2: (jokingly) Ah, so it's a cave system in a remote jungle? Or maybe a research station in the middle of nowhere?
P1: (teasingly) You're getting warmer! But not that warm!

**Turn 8**
P2: (exasperated) Okay, fine. I give up. You're just going to have to tell me when I get there, aren't you?
P1: (smiling slyly) Maybe... or maybe not.
