Here is the dialog:

**Turn 1**
P1: "Hey, P2! I was thinking of planning a surprise trip for us. What do you think?"

**Turn 2**
P2: "A surprise trip? That sounds suspicious. Where are we going?"

**Turn 3**
P1: "Oh, it's a wonderful place with lots of sunshine and fresh air. You'll love it!"

**Turn 4**
P2: "Hmm, that sounds weird. Is it a spa or something? Like, a yoga retreat in a hot desert?"

**Turn 5**
P1: "Ha ha, no, it's not a spa. But you will get to relax and unwind, I promise."

**Turn 6**
P2: "Okay, okay. I'll keep guessing. Is it a theme park? Like, a giant water park in the middle of the ocean?"

**Turn 7**
P1: "Uh, no... it's not a theme park. But you will see some amazing natural wonders."

**Turn 8**
P2: "Alright, I think I've got it! Is it a llama farm in the Andes? No? Okay, fine. Did you rent a villa in Antarctica?"

P1: "Uh... yeah, actually, it is a bit chilly there... and snowy... (Oops, did I say too much?)"

P2: "HA! I knew it! You're plotting something! Am I right, did we book a trip to the North Pole?"
