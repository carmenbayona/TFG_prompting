No, not Antarctica... but I do know someone who has a fascinating collection of penguins.\nP2: Okay, okay, so it's a llama farm, right?\nP1: Um, no... but have you ever heard of a place with super fluffy clouds?\nP2: Geez, you're really making me work for this. Did you book a trip to a cloud farm?\nP1: *accidentally* Oh, yeah, the weather is going to be just... um, cloudy.\nP2: Wait, what?! You're really going to cloud farm?!",
