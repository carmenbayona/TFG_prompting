  "Dialog": "P1: Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to plan a surprise trip! You're going to love it.\nP2: Uh, what's going on? You've been acting weird all week. Spill the beans, pal.\nP1: Nothing's going on, I just really need to get out of town for a bit, okay?\nP2: Okay, but I'm watching you. You're not getting away that easily. So, where is this mystery trip taking me?\nP1: Hmm, well, let's just say it's somewhere with a lot of... natural beauty.\nP2: Oh, natural beauty, huh? That's code for \"it's a llama farm, isn't it?\"\nP1: Ha! No, no llamas, I promise. But there will be some pretty cool wildlife.\nP2: Okay, okay, I'll play along. Is it, like, Antarctica or something?\nP1: *pauses* Well, it's not cold, exactly... but you will need a light jacket.\nP2: *laughs* Oh, you're a tough guy, huh? Alright, I'll keep guessing. How about a hot air balloon festival?\nP1: *laughs* No, no balloons. But you are getting warmer... or should I say, cooler?\nP2: *laughs* Oh, this is ridiculous. You're not even trying to hide it anymore. Just tell me where we're going!\nP1: *laughs* Okay, okay, I'll stop teasing you. But just for now!",
