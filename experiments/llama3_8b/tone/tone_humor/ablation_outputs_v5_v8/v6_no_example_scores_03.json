You're not even telling me where we're going, are you?\n\nP1: Uh, no... it's a surprise! But trust me, it'll be amazing!\n\nP2: Save it, I've seen some of these tactics before. Are we going to a llama farm?\n\nP1: Hmm, no... why would we go to a llama farm? That's not even a real vacation spot!\n\nP2: Oh, come on! You're not telling me because it's Antarctica, aren't you?\n\nP1: Uh, no... it's definitely not Antarctica! Although, I did hear it's going to be a bit chilly when we get there.\n\nP2: See, I knew it! You're taking me to the North Pole and making me ice-sculpture for the rest of the trip!\n\nP1: (laughs) No, no, no! That's not even close! Just trust me, you'll love it. Pack your bags and I'll reveal everything when we get there!\n\nP2: Fine, but if I end up in a bird sanctuary, I'm blaming you!",
