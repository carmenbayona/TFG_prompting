P1: Dude, I've got an amazing surprise for you! You're going to love it.
P2: Uh-oh, what's the catch? You're not planning on shipping me off to some remote cave in Antarctica, are you?
P1: Ha! No way, it's not that bad. But you have to pack light and be ready for an adventure.
P2: An adventure? You mean like the time you surprised me with a trip to the in-laws' house and we had to pretend to enjoy their hospitality?
P1: Well, this one's going to be much better, I promise! Just trust me and pack your bags.
P2: Okay, fine. But if we're going to a llama farm, I'm not going.
P1: No llamas, I swear! But you might want to bring a light jacket. It can get a bit chilly there.
P2: A light jacket? You're not going to tell me it's because we're going to the moon, are you?
P1: No, no, it's just a normal destination. I promise.
P2: Normal destination, huh? That's what you said about the time we went to the Renaissance faire and had to pay for a bunch of overpriced turkey legs.
P1: Okay, okay, I'll stop teasing you. Just pack your bags and you'll see!
