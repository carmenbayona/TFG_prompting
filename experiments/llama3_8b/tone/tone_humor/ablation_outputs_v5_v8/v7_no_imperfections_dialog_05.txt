P1: Oh man, I've been planning this surprise trip for weeks! You're going to love it!

P2: Hmm, what's going on? You're being super secretive about it. Is it because you're taking me to Antarctica to research penguins?

P1: No way, it's definitely not as chilly as that! But I will say, it's going to be a real adventure.

P2: Okay, so it's not Antarctica, but what about a llama farm then? You know I love those fuzzy creatures!

P1: Haha, no llamas either! But you're getting warmer... or should I say, sunnier?

P2: Ahah, sunshine! Is it some tropical island? Or maybe a spa resort? Spill the beans!

P1: Let's just say it's a place where the sun always shines... and we'll have plenty of time to relax.

P2: Okay, I'm guessing it's somewhere with a beach, but I'm still missing the "relaxation" part. Is it a cruise?

P1: Oh, you're getting close! But it's not a cruise... unless you consider a super-long road trip a "cruise".

P2: Ugh, really? So you're taking me on a road trip? And what's with the "super-long" part? You're not planning to drive to Timbuktu, are you?

P1: Um, no... but I did pack my sunglasses, just in case.

P2: Sunglasses? You're really testing my detective skills here!
