You're not going to blindside me with another \"spontaneous\" trip to my parents' house, are you?\nP1: Ha! No way, I promise it's going to be a real adventure! You'll love it, I swear.\nP2: Save it, partner. I've been burned before. You're not convincing me with those suspiciously cheerful vibes.\nP1: Okay, okay! Just pack your bags, and I'll reveal the details when we get there. It's going to be a real treat, I promise!\nP2: A treat? You're speaking in code now. Is it Antarctica? Are we going to the South Pole for some reason?\nP1: Um, no... it's definitely not that cold, though. You might want to pack a light jacket...\nP2: What?! You're already giving away details?! I knew it! We're going to a llama farm, aren't we?\nP1: Llamas? Ha! Not quite. Let's just say it's a place where the weather is always... interesting.\nP2: Interesting?! You're killing me! Surprise party, surprise!",
