P1: So, let's get started on our strategic planning meeting. I'm excited to discuss our future goals.

P2: Absolutely, I've been thinking a lot about our next projects. I think we have a great opportunity to really make an impact.

P1: I agree, but before we dive in, I want to make sure we're aligned on our priorities. What are your top concerns?

P2: Honestly, I'm worried about our current capacity to take on more projects. We need to make sure we have the right resources in place.

P1: That's a valid concern. We do need to be careful about overextending ourselves. (pauses) Let me think about that for a second. (clears throat) So, how do you see us allocating our resources?

P2: Well, I think we could use some of our existing infrastructure to support new projects. And I'd love to bring in some new team members to help with the workload.

P1: That sounds like a solid plan. (pauses again) But, I have to say, I'm not sure I'll be around to see those plans come to fruition.

P2: (laughs nervously) Oh, I didn't realize you were thinking about leaving? (awkwardly adds) Ah, I'm sure it's just a minor adjustment period.

P1: (laughs uncomfortably) Yeah, something like that. So, moving forward, what are your thoughts on our biggest opportunities for growth?

P2: I think we should focus on expanding into new markets. We have a unique product that could really disrupt the industry.

P1: That's an interesting idea. (hesitates) But, I'm not sure we have the right team in place to handle that kind of growth.

P2: (oblivious) Oh, I think we do. I've already started thinking about who we could bring in to lead the charge.
