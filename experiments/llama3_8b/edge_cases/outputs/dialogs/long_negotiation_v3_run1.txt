P1: I've been looking at the antique, and I have to say, I'm not convinced it's as rare as you claim. P2: Oh, come on, we've had experts verify its authenticity. P1: Experts can be wrong, and I think there are some red flags here. P2: (sighs) Look, we've sold similar pieces for this price before. P1: (interrupts) I've done my research, and those sales were questionable at best. P2: (frustrated) Questionable? You're just trying to lowball me. P1: (persistent) I'm just trying to get a fair price. P2: (defensive) This antique is worth every penny. P1: I understand it's valuable, but I have to point out that the restoration work is subpar. P2: (nervously) Ah, well, those are just minor cosmetic issues. P1: Minor cosmetic issues? That's at odds with the supposed rarity of the piece. P2: ( getting agitated) Look, the previous owner was a collector, and they paid top dollar for this. P1: (leaning in) I'm sure they did, but that doesn't justify the price you're asking now. P2: (firmly) The price is non-negotiable. P1: I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. P2: (firmly) Then I'll find someone who appreciates its value.
