P1: So, I wanted to clarify the deadline for the project. You mentioned it's imminent, correct?  
P2: Yes, absolutely. We're on track to meet it.  
P1: I see. I recall our previous conversation mentioning some challenges, but I didn't think they'd be major obstacles. Can you walk me through how you've addressed them?  
P2: Well, we've made significant progress on the key issues. I'm confident in our ability to hit the deadline.  
P1: That's good to hear. However, I do remember you saying that the team was still working on some fixes. How are those going?  
P2: Ah, yes, the fixes. They're on track to be completed soon. We're just fine-tuning a few things.  
P1: Fine-tuning, I see. That sounds like a relatively straightforward process. How long do you estimate it'll take?  
P2: (pausing slightly) Well, considering the scope of the changes, I'd say a few more weeks, tops.  
P1: A few weeks. That does seem a bit longer than I expected. Can you show me some of the updated documentation to confirm these changes?  
P2: (showing slight nervousness) Of course, I'll send it over later today. I'm sure it'll clarify everything.  
P1: Excellent. I appreciate your transparency. Just to recap, can you confirm that the deadline remains the same despite these additional changes?  
P2: (firmly) Absolutely. We're right on schedule.
