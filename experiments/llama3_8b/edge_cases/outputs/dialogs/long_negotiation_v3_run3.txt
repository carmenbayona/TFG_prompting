P1: So, the rare antique is still listed for a significant sum. 
P2: Yes, it's a valuable piece, and we're willing to wait for the right buyer. 
P1: I understand, but I'm not convinced it's worth that much. Can you tell me more about its condition? 
P2: Well, it's been expertly restored, and the craftsmanship is exceptional. 
P1: I see. And what makes you think it's authentic? It looks suspiciously modern. 
P2: (pausing) Ah, well, we have documentation from the previous owner, a reputable collector. 
P1: (interrupting) Documentation that's easily fabricated. I think we should be cautious. 
P2: (frustrated) Look, we've sold similar pieces before, and they've gone for top dollar. This one's worth every penny. 
P1: I'd like to see those sales records. Can you share them with me? 
P2: (sighing) Fine, but I have to remind you, this is a one-of-a-kind find. 
P1: One-of-a-kind doesn't necessarily mean it's worth a fortune. What's the lowest you're willing to go? 
P2: (firmly) We're not willing to negotiate. This is a fixed price. 
P1: (persistent) I understand that, but I think we can find common ground. How about we compromise on a lower price and an appraisal from an independent expert? 
P2: (hesitant) I...I'm not sure. That sounds like a lot of hassle. 
P1: It's a small price to pay for peace of mind. What do you say? Are you willing to consider it?
