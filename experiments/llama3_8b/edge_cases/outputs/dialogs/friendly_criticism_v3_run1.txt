P1: So, I wanted to touch base with you about the project's performance. How do you think it's going?
P2: Honestly, I'm a bit concerned. We've had some setbacks recently.
P1: Yeah, I agree. I think there have been a few areas where we could have done better. Specifically, the last three iterations have all had issues with...

P1: I appreciate that perspective, and I'm glad to hear the team was working hard. However, as the project lead, I have to consider the bigger picture. And in this case, I think we need to identify what went wrong and make some changes.
P2: (becoming slightly defensive) I understand what you're saying, but I think you're being a bit too harsh. We did make some good decisions, like...

P1: That's a great idea. I'll make sure to pass that along to the team lead. And again, I want to emphasize that this feedback isn't meant to be personal or critical. It's really just about the project's success.
P2: I appreciate that. And I appreciate your honesty. It's good to know what we need to work on.
