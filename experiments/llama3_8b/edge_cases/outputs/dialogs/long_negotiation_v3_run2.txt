P1: So, you're still insisting on the asking price of $50,000?  
P2: Yes, I am. This antique is a rare find, and I've had multiple offers already.  
P1: Multiple offers? What makes you think they're serious? Do you have any proof?  
P2: Well, one of them was a collector who actually came to see the piece in person. And I have references from previous sales, if you'd like to see them.  
P1: (interrupting) References? I'd love to see them, but first, can you tell me more about this supposed collector? What's his reputation?  
P2: (frustrated) Look, I'm not at liberty to disclose that information. But I assure you, he's a reputable collector. Now, are you interested in making an offer or not?  
P1: (calmly) Okay, okay. I'm interested. But I need to ask, have you ever had any experts authenticate this piece? It looks like it might be...a reproduction?  
P2: (defensively) It's not a reproduction! I've had multiple appraisers verify its authenticity. And like I said, I've had other offers already.  
P1: (pushing) But at what price? What's the highest offer you've received so far?  
P2: (hesitating) Well...I've had one offer for $30,000, but the buyer backed out at the last minute.  
P1: (persistent) And what about the reproduction concerns? Have you addressed those with the appraisers? Can I see the reports?  
P2: (irritated) Look, we can discuss this all day, but at the end of the day, this antique is worth every penny of that price. I'm not willing to budge.
