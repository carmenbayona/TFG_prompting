P1: Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the project deadline. I wanted to confirm the exact date we're working towards.
P2: Of course, I'm happy to clarify. We're aiming to submit the project by the 15th of next month.
P1: That's what I thought. I remember discussing the timeline with you earlier, and you mentioned the 20th was the deadline.
P2: Actually, I think we discussed the 15th as the target date, not the 20th.
P1: I could've sworn it was the 20th. Can you remind me why we chose the 15th specifically?
P2: We felt it would give us sufficient time to review and revise the project to meet the client's requirements.
P1: That's a good point. How do you plan to ensure the team stays on track to meet this deadline?
P2: We've established a detailed project schedule and are tracking progress closely to avoid any delays.
P1: I see. Just to clarify, are there any potential roadblocks you're aware of that could impact the deadline?
P2: We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far, everything appears to be on track to meet the deadline.
P1: Thank you for your time today. I appreciate your clarification on the deadline.
P2: No problem at all.
