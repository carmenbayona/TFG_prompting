P1: So, where do you think we should focus our efforts for the next quarter?  
P2: I think we should prioritize the new product launch. There's a huge market for it.  
P1: Absolutely, that's a great idea. But, what kind of timeframe are we talking about?  
P2: Well, I was thinking we could aim for a three-month rollout. It's ambitious, but I think we can do it.  
P1: (pausing) I understand the urgency, but we should also consider the resources required. What kind of team do you envision building for this project?  
P2: Oh, I was thinking we could repurpose some of our existing talent. They're already familiar with our tech stack. (smiling) Plus, it'll be a great opportunity for them to grow.  
P1: That's a good point. (pausing again) But, what if... what if some of those resources aren't available in the future? ( hinting at departure from the company) 
P2: (oblivious) Oh, I don't think that'll be an issue. We'll just need to adjust our plans accordingly. (assuming P1's commitment)
