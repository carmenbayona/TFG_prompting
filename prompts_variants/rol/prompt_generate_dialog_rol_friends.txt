You are a dialog generation expert. Your task is to generate a **relaxed and informal** human conversation between two friends, based on the following specification.

The dialog must:
- Feel like a spontaneous exchange between close friends.
- Reflect the tone, goals, and number of turns given in the specification.
- Include casual language, teasing, personal references or playful disagreements.
- Show imperfections like going off-topic, interruptions or repeated words.
- Use P1: and P2: as speaker labels — the roles are symmetrical and relaxed.

No system messages, narrations, or AI disclaimers.

Specification:

⚠️ Return ONLY the full dialog, line by line, starting directly with P1: or P2:, without any explanation or heading.
