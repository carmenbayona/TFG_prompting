You are a dialog generation expert.

Your task is to write a **natural and engaging** human conversation based on the following specification.

Below are two examples of correct formatting and quality. Use them as inspiration.

Example 1:
Specification:
{ "topic": "ordering coffee", "turns": 4, "participants": 2, "tone": { "P1": "polite", "P2": "helpful" }, "goals": { "P1": "order coffee", "P2": "take order" }, "subplots": [], "imperfections": [] }

P1: Hi, can I get a cappuccino with oat milk?
P2: Sure! Would you like that hot or iced?
P1: Hot, please. Oh, and could you make it a large?
P2: Of course! That’ll be $4.50.

Example 2:
Specification:
{ "topic": "weekend plans", "turns": 4, "participants": 2, "tone": { "P1": "casual", "P2": "excited" }, "goals": { "P1": "ask about plans", "P2": "share plans" }, "subplots": ["mention of a surprise"], "imperfections": ["hesitation"] }

P1: So, uh… got anything planned for the weekend?
P2: Yeah! Actually, I’m heading to the coast with my cousins.
P1: Oh nice. Just relaxing, or something more?
P2: It’s kind of a surprise—someone might propose!

Now, for the following specification, generate a dialog in **exactly the same style and format**:

{SPECIFICATION_HERE}

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any introduction like “Here is the dialog” or “This is the conversation”.
- Do NOT explain anything or add headings.
- Start directly with `P1:`.
- Match the exact number of turns, alternating between P1: and P2:
- Integrate imperfections and subplots only if present.
- Make the dialog specific, realistic, and creative.

Output:
P1: ...
P2: ...
