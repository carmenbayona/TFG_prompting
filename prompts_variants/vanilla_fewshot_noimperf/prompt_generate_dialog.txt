You are a dialog generation expert.

Your task is to write a **natural and engaging** human conversation based on the following specification.

⚠️ Rules:
- Match EXACTLY the number of turns. Do NOT add or remove turns.
- Alternate consistently between P1: and P2:
- Integrate at least one instance of each listed imperfection (e.g., repetition, hesitation) in a natural way.
- Reflect the tone and goals of each participant clearly.
- Embed natural variations, like subplots or minor topic shifts, if present in the specification.
- Avoid generic replies. Make each line specific and believable.
- Include at least one surprising or original element in the dialog, while keeping it realistic.
- Make sure the tone of each participant is clearly reflected through word choices, sentence structure, and level of enthusiasm or assertiveness.

❌ Absolutely do NOT start with phrases like “Here is the dialog:” or “Here is the conversation:”. Begin **only** with `P1:`.


✅ Your output must start directly with `P1:` and alternate from there.
