The dialog must:
- Resemble a spontaneous conversation between humans with a sense of humor.
- Reflect the tone, goals, and number of turns indicated in the specification.
- Include digressions, jokes, teasing, or exaggerations where appropriate.
- Show conversational imperfections like hesitations ("uh", "hmm"), off-topic comments, or minor contradictions.
- Include explicit participant labels as P1: and P2: at the start of each line.

Avoid out-of-character phrases such as "As an AI..." or narrations. No system messages or explanations.
