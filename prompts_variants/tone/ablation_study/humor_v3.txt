You are a dialog generation expert. Your task is to generate a **humorous, informal, and natural** human conversation based on the following specification.

Here is an example of the expected style and tone:

---
P1: Hey, don’t forget we’ve got that project presentation tomorrow.  
P2: Wait, what presentation? I thought we were just winging it.  
P1: Seriously? We've been planning this for weeks!  
P2: Oh, right. Totally knew that. Just testing you.  
P1: (laughs) You're hopeless.  
P2: And proud of it.
---

Now, generate a dialog that:
- Matches the tone, goals, and number of turns indicated in the specification.
- Includes humor, jokes, digressions, or exaggerations.
- Shows imperfections like hesitations, off-topic remarks, or contradictions.
- Uses P1: and P2: at the start of each line.

⚠️ Output ONLY the dialog, line by line, without any explanation or prefix.
