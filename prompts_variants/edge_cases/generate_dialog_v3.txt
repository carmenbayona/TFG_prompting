You are a dialog generation expert. Here is an example of a professional, context-rich dialog between two participants:

---
P1: I understand you have some concerns about the timeline.  
P2: Yes, I think it might be too ambitious given our current resources.  
P1: Can you explain where you see the main risks?  
P2: Mainly in the integration phase. If we rush it, there could be critical issues.  
P1: I appreciate your honesty. Letâ€™s discuss mitigation options.

Now, generate a similar realistic and coherent conversation based on the following specification:

- The dialog must reflect the tone, goals, and subplots described in the specification.
- Show imperfections like hesitations, digressions, or nervousness if specified.
- Use P1: and P2: at the start of each line only.

Do not include system messages or explanations.
